### Retinal Fundus Image Report

**Patient Information**: Confidential

**Date**: [Insert Date]

---

**1. Optic Disc**
- **Appearance**: The optic disc appears to be a small, well-defined, round structure.
- **Color**: It shows a pale coloration which can be suggestive of optic atrophy or other pathology.
- **Margination**: The margins of the optic disc are well-defined, with no evidence of edema or neovascularization.
- **Observation**: The pale coloration might indicate a past event of ischemia or a hereditary optic neuropathy. Detailed history and further diagnostics might be needed.

**2. Macula**
- **Appearance**: The macular area shows significant abnormality.
- **Details & Lesions**: The central macula displays a pronounced circular lesion with a halo and pale center which suggests central halo choroidal dystrophy. This diagnosis is based on the appearance of bilateral, symmetrical lesions confined to the macula without related external lesions as detailed in the reference texts. 
- **Implications**: This condition can lead to central vision loss; therefore, ongoing monitoring of the visual acuity and possible genetic consultation may be required.

**3. Retinal Blood Vessels**
- **Arteries & Veins**: The arteries and veins appear to be within normal size, with no neovascularization or evident occlusions.
- **Vessel Distribution**: The retinal vessels are uniformly distributed across the retina.
- **Notable Observations**: No signs of retinal arterial macroaneurysm are observed, which can cause severe vision loss if it affects the central macular region.

**4. Retinal Background**
- **General Appearance**: The retinal background is crimson, indicating a healthy retinal blood supply without evidence of subretinal hemorrhage or widespread atrophy.
- **Lesions**: No other peripheral lesions are noted in the fundus.

**5. Cup-to-Disc Ratio**
- **Estimation**: Due to the image clarity, a precise cup-to-disc ratio cannot be determined. However, it appears to be within normal limits given the rounded structure.
- **Implications**: A detailed examination might be required to rule out glaucomatous changes if the patient has risk factors for glaucoma.

### Conclusion:
The above findings suggest the presence of central halo choroidal dystrophy limited to the macular region. The optic disc showing signs of pallor may require further investigation to rule out optic atrophy. The retinal vessels and background are essentially normal with no additional alarming pathology. Regular follow-ups, detailed ocular examination, and possibly consultation with a retinal specialist are advised.

### Follow-Up Recommendations:
1. **Thorough Medical History**: A detailed history may provide insight into any past events of ischemia or hereditary conditions affecting the optic disc.
2. **Visual Acuity Monitoring**: Regular checks on visual acuity to monitor the progress of macular involvement.
3. **OCT and Fluorescein Angiography**: Advanced imaging techniques for a deeper understanding of macular structure and blood flow.
4. **Genetic Counseling**: If central halo choroidal dystrophy is confirmed, genetic counseling might be beneficial for the patient's family planning and awareness.

Combined Texts:
Section II	Choroidal dystrophy  1. Central halo choroidal dystrophy: At any time, the lesions were bilateral, symmetrical, confined to the macula, and were not related to other lesions.
RETINOBLASTOMA  PROGNOSIS: Prognostic factors for failure to preserve vision or to preserve the eye are larger tumor size, vitreous seeding, and macular involvement.
RETINAL ARTERIAL MACROANEURYSM  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT: The visual prognosis depends on whether bleeding involves the central macular region. In such instances, vision can be reduced to counting fingers or worse. Spontaneous improvement can occur, particularly when the blood is located superficially within the retina. Involvement of the macula by edema can lead to visual loss, typically ranging from 20/25 to 20/200.
CHOROIDAL NEVUS  DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Subretinal hemorrhage
CHOROIDAL MELANOMA  ASSOCIATED CLINICAL SIGNS: Subretinal hemorrhage
TERSON'S SYNDROME: Terson's syndrome encompasses any intraocular (usually preretinal or vitreous) hemorrhage associated with either trauma induced or spontaneous acute intracranial bleeding.
Section 3 Optic nerve and blood vessels  5. Blood supply in the posterior area of the sieve plate: The posterior cribriform plate region receives blood supplies from various sources, such as branches from the Zinn arterial ring and branches from the pial vessels forming a vascular network
PERSISTENT HYPERPLASTIC PRIMARY VITREOUS/PERSISTENT FETAL VASCULATURE  EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY: Anterior and posterior forms exist, and both may be present together.
Section IX	macular hole: Stage II: Continuous tangential traction causes photoreceptors and radial nerve fibers to move eccentrically, and the central part of the fovea splits to form a stage II hole. At this time, local PVD occurs.

### Retinal Fundus Image Analysis Report

#### **Patient Information:**
- **Image ID:** Not provided
- **Date:** Not provided
- **Eye:** Not specified (Assumed right/left based on image orientation)

#### **1. Optic Disc:**
- The optic disc is not visible in the available image. This could be due to the image capturing a peripheral region of the retina, or the presence of some pathological obscuration. Further imaging might be required to visualize the optic disc properly for assessment.

#### **2. Macula:**
- The macula is not visible in this section of the retinal image. This could indicate that the image is capturing a more peripheral portion of the retina rather than the central macula region. 

#### **3. Retinal Blood Vessels:**
- The retinal blood vessels in the image appear to disperse normally within the retinal background. There are no obvious signs of vessel occlusion, hemorrhage, or significant tortuosity in this region. 

#### **4. Retinal Background:**
- There are areas with significant pigmentation and atrophy, particularly noticeable in the lower part of the image. The pigmentary changes are consistent with possible chorioretinal coloboma, which involves an area of missing or underdeveloped tissue in the retina and choroid. The blackened area could indicate a colobomatous defect.
- These areas show irregular pigmentation with both hypo- and hyperpigmentation, indicative of chronic changes. There is also evidence of scarring and possible atrophy.

#### **5. Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
- The cup-to-disc ratio cannot be assessed in this image since the optic disc is not visible.

#### **6. Additional Observations:**
- Based on the reference texts and the visible chorioretinal abnormalities, this image shows a significant amount of pigment change which could be associated with chorioretinal coloboma. This condition commonly does not require treatment unless complicated by a retinal detachment.
- Given the presence of significant pigmentary changes and possible chorioretinal coloboma, patients with such findings should be monitored for associated complications such as retinal detachment.
- No active signs of inflammation or infection are noted in this view of the retina.

#### **Conclusion and Recommendations:**
- **Diagnosis:**
  - Likely chorioretinal coloboma given the presence of dark pigmentation and areas of scarring.
  - Consider retinal detachment as a differential diagnosis; however, no acute signs are present in this image.

- **Recommendations:**
  - Follow-up imaging and comprehensive ophthalmic exam, including visualization of the optic disc and macula.
  - Patient education regarding symptoms of retinal detachment.
  - Consider ancillary testing such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) or further imaging if needed to assess retinal layers and optic disc.
  - Regular monitoring for complications such as retinal detachment or new vascular changes in the region of the coloboma.

Section II	non-infectious chorioretinitis  3. Intermediate uveitis: Using binocular indirect ophthalmoscope and scleral compression to observe the periphery of the fundus, vitreous inflammatory cells and inflammatory cells gather into snowballs; vitreous inflammatory cells may vary in severity, which may make the fundus unclear. At the flat part of the ciliary body and the periphery of the retina, there are disseminated grayish-yellow exudation foci, with white sheaths in the peripheral retinal blood vessels; when the inflammation is relieved, the exudation scarring and forms grayish-white atrophy spots, which may be accompanied by pigment disorder; The exudation spreads to both sides, forming snow bank-like changes, which is pathologically a proliferative lesion; in the later stage, it is an organized membrane, and the contraction of the organized membrane produces traction retinal and choroid detachment; The organizing membrane carries new blood vessels, which is a potential cause of retinal hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage.

Section 1 Congenital dysplasia of optic nerve and optic disc  1. Congenital optic nerve and optic disc agenesis: 6. The optic nerve papilla has not been formed in the fundus, and the optic disc and corresponding blood vessels are not distributed, and disorderly choroidal blood vessels can be seen. Patients often have small eyes and no light perception.
Section II	Special types of rhegmatogenous retinal detachment  5. Congenital optic disc fovea complicated with retinal detachment: [Clinical manifestations] The congenital optic disc fovea is mostly located on the temporal side of the optic disc. If macular retinal detachment does not occur, the patient generally has no vision impairment and is not easy to detect. About half of patients develop retinal detachment in the macula area between the ages of 20 and 40, which may be accompanied by decreased vision, distorted vision, and microvision.
TERSON'S SYNDROME  CLINICAL SIGNS: Other ocular signs associated with Terson's syndrome include cranial nerve palsies, late appearing epiretinal membrane, or tractional retinal detachment.
CHORIORETINAL COLOBOMA  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT: No treatment is necessary unless retinal detachment occurs .
RETINAL BREAK OR TEAR  IMPORTANT CLINICAL SIGNS: Retinal dialysis: Disinsertion of the retina from the pars plana at the ora serrata; most often inferotemporal; superonasal is virtually pathognomonic for trauma.
Section 1 Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: Retinal detachment with automatic reattachment is occasionally seen due to the small tear and slow development of proliferative retinopathy, which reattaches spontaneously without treatment. Often, the medical history lasts for several years, and the retina in all or the affected part of the fundus loses transparency, irregular pigmentation occurs, and white lines under the retina proliferate.
CHOROIDAL DETACHMENT  IMPORTANT CLINICAL SIGNS: If large enough, the detachment may obstruct the examiner's view of the optic nerve and macula. If elevations are very large, they may contact each other in vitreous cavity (“kissing choroidals").

### Detailed Retinal Image Report

**Optic Disc:**
- **Appearance:** The optic disc appears to be well-defined with no apparent swelling or pallor.
- **Observations:** There is no evidence of disc edema. The cup-to-disc ratio is approximately 0.3, indicating that there is no significant cupping present.
- **Clinical Significance:** A well-defined optic disc with a normal cup-to-disc ratio suggests absence of glaucomatous changes.

**Macula:**
- **Appearance:** The macula shows signs of solar maculopathy with areas of hyperpigmentation noted in the foveal and parafoveal regions.
- **Observations:** There appears to be a focal area of retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) changes in the foveal area.
- **Clinical Significance:** The presence of focal hyperpigmentation is characteristic of solar maculopathy, likely a result of phototoxic damage to the retinal pigment epithelium.

**Retinal Blood Vessels:**
- **Appearance:** The retinal blood vessels appear normal with no signs of arteriovenous nicking, narrowing, or dilation.
- **Observations:** There are no significant changes in the caliber of the blood vessels, and no hemorrhages are observed.
- **Clinical Significance:** The normal appearance of the retinal blood vessels rules out hypertensive retinopathy and states such as branch retinal artery obstruction or cilio-retinal artery obstruction.

**Retinal Background:**
- **Appearance:** The retinal background shows well-demarcated cotton-wool spots.
- **Observations:** Cotton-wool spots are present without accompanying retinal hemorrhages.
- **Clinical Significance:** The presence of cotton-wool spots indicates localized retinal ischemia and should prompt further investigation. However, the absence of accompanying hemorrhages helps in differentiating from other conditions that could also present similarly.

**Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
- **Measurement:** The cup-to-disc ratio is estimated to be 0.3.
- **Clinical Significance:** This is within the normal range and does not suggest glaucoma.

**Conclusions:**
- The patient exhibits signs of solar maculopathy, characterized by retinal pigment epithelial changes in the foveal and parafoveal regions.
- The presence of cotton-wool spots suggests localized retinal ischemia, necessitating further clinical investigation.
- No significant abnormalities in the retinal blood vessels or optic disc that suggest hypertensive retinopathy or retinal artery occlusion. Regular monitoring and comprehensive screening are indicated for any underlying systemic causes of retinal ischemia.

Clinician's attention is advised to correlate these findings with the patient's history, clinical symptoms, and other relevant diagnostic tests.

**Retinal Fundus Image Analysis Report**

**Patient Information:**
- **Eye:** Not specified

**Image Analysis:**

**1. Optic Disc:**
   - The optic disc is round with a clearly defined margin.
   - The color of the disc appears normal, exhibiting a healthy pinkish hue indicative of a well-perfused disc.
   - No signs of disc edema or pallor are noted, suggesting no evidence of ischemic or inflammatory optic neuropathy.
   - The blood vessels emerging from the optic disc show no abnormal dilation or tortuosity.
  
**2. Macula:**
   - The macula is centrally located and visible as a darker spot.
   - There are no evident signs of macular edema, hemorrhage, or exudates within this region.
   - The foveal reflex is less prominent, but there is no evidence of central serous chorioretinopathy or pattern dystrophy affecting the macula.

**3. Retinal Blood Vessels:**
   - The retinal arteriole and venule are observed to be of standard caliber with no pronounced narrowing or dilatation.
   - There is no evidence of arteriovenous nicking, which rules out hypertensive retinopathy.
   - No abnormalities such as microaneurysms or neovascularization are noted, suggesting the absence of diabetic retinopathy or vascular occlusion.
  
**4. Retinal Background:**
   - The retinal background is uniformly pigmented, indicating a healthy retinal pigment epithelium.
   - No observable signs of retinal hemorrhage, hard exudates, cotton-wool spots, or drusen are present, ruling out conditions like diabetic retinopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, and age-related macular degeneration.
   - There are a few areas at the superior part of the image displaying what appears to be white patches that could possibly be soft exudates or remnants from a past condition, necessitating further scrutiny.

**5. Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
   - The cup-to-disc ratio appears within normal limits, estimated roughly around 0.3.
   - There is no evidence of glaucomatous changes such as an increased cup-to-disc ratio or optic disc notching.

**Impression:**
The retinal fundus image visualizes a generally healthy retina with an intact optic disc and macula. The retinal vasculature does not demonstrate any noteworthy pathological changes. The few white patches noted superiorly on the retinal background warrant further assessment to rule out any residual effects from past ocular conditions, but they do not appear to be currently active lesions.

**Recommendations:**
- Follow-up with a detailed ocular examination if the patient has any symptoms or history of ocular disease.
- Consider additional imaging studies such as Fluorescein Angiography (FA) or OCT if further investigation is required based on clinical suspicion.
- Routine monitoring if the patient is asymptomatic and has no significant ocular or systemic history.

**Conclusion:**
The overall evaluation of this retinal fundus image suggests a healthy retina with minor findings that are likely residual and non-active, necessitating just standard follow-up care unless further clinical symptoms dictate otherwise.

- The retinal background shows a mottled appearance with areas of hypo- and hyperpigmentation.
- There are multiple dark patches and light-colored lesions scattered throughout, possibly indicative of retinal ischemia or infiltrates.
- The presence of extensive retinal hemorrhages raises the concern for a systemic vasculopathy or severe infectious/inflammatory condition affecting the retinal integrity.

**Differential Diagnosis:**
- **Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) Retinopathy:** Given the presence of dilated vessels, hemorrhages, and signs of retinal vasculitis, SLE could be a primary consideration, especially if there are concurrent systemic symptoms and positive serologies (e.g., anti-phospholipid antibodies).
- **Hypertensive Retinopathy:** Could be a possibility with presence of hemorrhages and vessel changes.
- **Behçet’s Disease:** Characterized by uveitis and systemic symptoms, should be considered if the patient has oral/genital ulcers or systemic vasculitis indicators.

**Recommendations:**
- **Systemic Evaluation:** Detailed systemic workup including autoimmune and infectious serologies, blood pressure monitoring.
- **Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT):** To evaluate the macular edema and retinal layer changes.
- **Fluorescein Angiography:** To assess the extent of vascular leakage and occlusion.
- **Referral to Rheumatology:** If systemic connective tissue disease is suspected.
- **Close Monitoring:** Regular follow-ups to monitor progression and response to any initiated treatment.

This detailed analysis suggests a significant retinal pathology consistent with a systemic disease impacting the ocular vessels severely. Prompt interdisciplinary collaboration is essential for accurate diagnosis and management.

Section IV	connective tissue disease  1. Lupus erythematosus retinopathy: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) is a connective tissue disease of unknown etiology and is generally considered to be an autoimmune connective tissue disease. It mainly occurs in young women, accounting for about 90%, but it can also affect children. The course of disease is long and affects many tissues and organs throughout the body, and the eyes are often affected.
Section 1 Fundus changes in systemic lupus erythematosus: Systemic lupus erythematosus is a connective tissue disease that is not uncommon in clinical practice and is most common in young and middle-aged female patients. It can invade multiple parts and organs of the body such as skin, joints, heart, lungs, kidneys and other organs. Patients with diverse clinical symptoms, including fever, accelerated erythrocyte sedimentation rate, etc., and positive anti-phospholipid antibodies in their blood are called secondary anti-phospholipid syndrome. The main manifestations of fundus are retinal vasculitis and retrobulbar optic neuritis. Retinal vasculitis is mainly manifested as small vessel obstructive microangiopathy. It may be the reaction of immunoglobulin and its components on the vessel wall to microangiopathy. Severe retinal vascular lesions are central retinal artery occlusion and central retinal vein occlusion, often accompanied by retinal hemorrhage and new blood vessels. Late stage has optic nerve atrophy.
Section II	non-infectious chorioretinitis  1. Behcet disease: [Definition] Behcet's disease was once known as Behcet syndrome. It is a chronic disease that affects multiple organs throughout the body. It is characterized by uveitis, oral ulcers, pleomorphic skin lesions, and genital ulcers. It can also damage the central nervous system of joints and gastrointestinal tract, also known as skin-mucosa-eye syndrome. Hulusi Behcet first reported in detail in 1936, so he was named after his surname.
FAMILIAL EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY  DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION: Typical fundus findings are noted on ophthalmoscopy.
Section IV	Fundus changes in degenerative myopia: [Treatment and Prognosis] Various pathological changes in the fundus of degenerative myopia are difficult to reverse once they are formed. So far, there is no definite effective treatment method.
RETINOBLASTOMA  DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION: Detailed systemic evaluation and examination is required, as well as family history and ocular examination of parents, and complete examination of both eyes (often requiring anesthesia for complete visualization of the fundi with scleral depression).

## Retinal Fundus Image Report

### Optic Disc
- **Appearance**: The optic disc shows significant swelling and a blurred margin, indicating **disc edema**. 
- **Color**: The disc appears lighter in color, which is consistent with edema.
- **Blood Vessels**: The vessels on the disc appear dilated and anastomosed. This is typically seen in cases of optic disc edema.

### Cup-to-Disc Ratio
- **Observation**: Due to the severe swelling and blurred margins of the optic disc, the cup-to-disc ratio is indistinguishable in this image. Accurate assessment of this ratio is not possible under these conditions.

### Macula
- **Observation**: The macula is not distinctly visible in this image. The presence of disc edema can obscure the view of the macula, making it challenging to assess its condition accurately.

### Retinal Blood Vessels
- **Arteries and Veins**: The retinal blood vessels, both arteries, and veins, appear dilated. There is a noticeable tortuosity, which is commonly seen in conditions involving increased intracranial pressure or severe disc edema.
- **Hemorrhages**: There are no obvious signs of retinal hemorrhages in this localized view.

### Retinal Background
- **General Appearance**: The retinal background appears orange-red, typical of a healthy retina. The visibility of vasculature and the general coloration do not indicate any widespread retinal pathology.
- **Lesions**: No cotton-wool spots, microaneurysms, or other common retinal lesions are visible in this segment of the image.

### Interpretation and Diagnosis
The primary observation from the retinal fundus image is significant optic disc edema. This edema suggests potential underlying conditions such as papilledema due to increased intracranial pressure, anterior ischemic optic neuropathy, or severe optic neuritis. 

Considering the absence of other profound retinal abnormalities such as hemorrhages, cotton-wool spots, or signs of retinal detachment, the focus would remain primarily on addressing the cause of the disc edema. 

### Recommendations
1. **Immediate Referral**: Refer the patient to a neuro-ophthalmologist and obtain an urgent neuro-imaging study (MRI) to rule out intracranial pathology.
2. **Systemic Evaluation**: A thorough systemic evaluation including blood pressure monitoring, complete blood count, and inflammatory markers (ESR, CRP) should be undertaken.
3. **Follow-Up**: Regular follow-ups with both the ophthalmologist and neurologist are necessary to monitor the progression and response to any treatment initiated.

### Conclusion
The fundus image indicates severe optic disc edema with associated dilated and tortuous blood vessels. Accurate cup-to-disc ratio assessment is not possible due to the edema. Further systemic and neurological evaluation is necessary to determine the underlying cause and appropriate management plan.

RETINAL BREAK OR TEAR  IMPORTANT CLINICAL SIGNS: Retinal dialysis: Disinsertion of the retina from the pars plana at the ora serrata; most often inferotemporal; superonasal is virtually pathognomonic for trauma.
CENTRAL RETINAL ARTERY OBSTRUCTION(OCCLUSION)  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT: The visual prognosis is typically poor, with most patients retaining counting finger to hand motions vision and a small temporal island of vision remaining. If a cilioretinal artery spares the central fovea, 80% of eyes will return to 20/20 to 20/50 vision over aperiod of 2 weeks. Nevertheless, in the latter instance there is typically severe visual field loss. Approximately 18% of eyes will progress to develop iris neovascularization within 4 to 6 weeks after the acute obstruction.

## Retinal Fundus Image Analysis Report

### 1. Optic Disc
- **Observation**: The optic disc appears obscured and is difficult to delineate clearly in this image. There is significant blurring and the margins are not distinctly visible.
- **Analysis**: This could be indicative of an underlying retinal pathology such as optic disc edema or severe retinopathy. The indistinct margins may suggest advanced diabetic retinopathy, possibly at a proliferative stage where neovascularization obscures the disc.

### 2. Macula
- **Observation**: The macular region is not clearly identifiable from this fundus image; the central area surrounding the optic disc appears extensively affected by retinal changes.
- **Analysis**: The lack of clarity and the obscured view could point towards maculopathy, which often accompanies advanced stages of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, particularly if associated with macular edema or exudates impeding detailed visualization.

### 3. Retinal Blood Vessels
- **Observation**: Retinal blood vessels appear to be present but are significantly blurred and partially obscured by bright areas.
- **Analysis**: This may be indicative of proliferative diabetic retinopathy, where neovascularization causes new, fragile blood vessels to grow, which may hemorrhage and obscure the view as seen in the image.

### 4. Retinal Background
- **Observation**: The retinal background is extensively affected, showing multiple areas of bright red and orange, with intense areas of light suggesting exudation or hemorrhage.
- **Analysis**: These findings are consistent with severe retinal pathology such as diabetic retinopathy. The spread and intensity of these changes suggest advanced disease, which could include proliferative changes and possibly vitreous hemorrhage.

### 5. Cup-to-Disc Ratio
- **Observation**: Due to the obscured optic disc and margins, an accurate assessment of the cup-to-disc ratio is not feasible in this image.
- **Analysis**: The inability to determine the cup-to-disc ratio further supports the presence of significant pathology. The primary concern here would be the impact of neovascularization and exudates affecting optic disc visibility.

### Conclusion
The retinal fundus image presents with severe abnormalities suggestive of advanced proliferative diabetic retinopathy. The extensive blurring, bright exudative areas, and poorly delineated optic disc are consistent with significant retinal disease. Immediate attention and further diagnostic evaluation such as fluorescein angiography and optical coherence tomography (OCT) are recommended for a comprehensive assessment. Urgent referral to a retinal specialist is advisable to manage the potential complications related to this condition.

Section 2 Diabetic Retinopathy  2. Classification standards: The occurrence and development of diabetic retinopathy is a long clinical process. Depending on blood sugar levels, blood sugar control, other systemic lesions and individual differences, the speed of development of the disease varies.

### Patient Information
- **Patient ID:** [Placeholder]
- **Date of Examination:** [Placeholder]

### Observational Analysis

#### 1. Optic Disc
- **Appearance:** The optic disc is not visible in this image, suggesting the captured area might be focused away from the optic disc region. 
- **Color:** Not applicable.
- **Margins:** Not applicable.
- **Peripapillary Area:** Not applicable.

#### 2. Macula
- **Appearance:** The macula itself is not distinctly visible in this image. 
- **Possible Conditions:** Without a clear view of the macula, specific conditions like "central halo choroidal dystrophy" or "solar maculopathy" cannot be confirmed or ruled out.

#### 3. Retinal Blood Vessels
- **Appearance:** The retinal blood vessels appear thin and are evenly distributed across the observed area. There are no signs of vessel tortuosity or other abnormalities indicative of conditions like hypertensive retinopathy or retinal detachment complications.
- **Pathology:** No apparent abnormalities such as abnormal anastomoses, side branches, or fluorescing vessels are observed.

#### 4. Retinal Background
- **Pigmentation:** The retinal background appears uniformly orange-red, indicating a fairly healthy choroidal vasculature.
- **Lesions:** There are no evident lesions such as exudates, hemorrhages, or choroidal neovascular membranes in this view. Conditions such as Behçet's disease, non-infectious chorioretinitis, or complex rhegmatogenous retinal detachment can generally be ruled out based on the absence of these signs.
- **Fluorescence:** There is no emphasis on fluorescence in this standard image, so further analysis using fluorescein angiography might be necessary if abnormalities were suspected.

#### 5. Cup-to-Disc Ratio
- **Ratio:** Not applicable due to the optic disc not being visible in this image.

### Summary and Recommendations

- **Observations:** This retinal fundus image showcases an area that is relatively free from observable pathological signs.
- **Recommendation:** To offer a comprehensive evaluation, it would be beneficial to acquire additional images encompassing the optic disc and macula regions.

### Possible Clinical Correlations
Given no significant abnormalities, there are no immediate signs of:

- **Choroidal dystrophy**
- **Solar maculopathy**
- **Behçet's disease**
- **Proliferative vitreoretinopathy**
- **Retinitis pigmentosa**
- **Hypertensive retinopathy**
- **Cilioretinal artery obstruction**

Further diagnostic evaluation can be determined based on a more complete retinal examination if needed.

   - **Arteries and Veins:** The major retinal arteries and veins radiate from the optic disc and appear to be of normal caliber. There is no significant attenuation or tortuosity.
   - **Hemorrhages/Exudates:** There are no obvious retinal hemorrhages or exudates observed in this image.

4. **Retinal Background:**
   - **General Appearance:** The retinal background exhibits a reddish hue with several whitish streaks and lattice-like alterations observed in the superior quadrant. This may suggest vitreoretinal traction or changes.
   - **Pathological Signs:** The presence of whitish streaks is indicative of possible areas of fibrovascular proliferation or other pathologies such as vitreoretinal adhesion or retinoschisis.

5. **Other Observations:**
   - **Peripheral Retina:** There are no clear signs of peripheral retinal degeneration such as cobblestone degeneration or lattice degeneration.
   - **Choroidal Lesions:** No choroidal neovascular membranes or signs of exudative chorioretinopathy are noted.

**Summary and Impressions:**

- The optic disc appears normal with a physiologic cup-to-disc ratio.
- Macular changes, including hypo- and hyperpigmentation, suggest a potential macular dystrophy or hereditary condition.
- The retina shows whitish streaks in the superior quadrant, suggesting possible vitreoretinal traction or retinoschisis.
- There are no signs of acute hemorrhage, exudates, or choroidal neovascularization.
- Further diagnostic evaluation with fundus fluorescence angiography and electroretinography may be warranted, especially in the context of hereditary patterns.

**Recommendations:**

1. **Referral to Specialist:**
   - Consider referral to a retinal specialist for further evaluation of macular changes and peripheral retinal findings.
   
2. **Ancillary Testing:**
   - Perform fundus fluorescence angiography to assess for any abnormal fluorescence patterns, which can help in diagnosing underlying pathologies.
   - Electroretinogram (ERG) to evaluate retinal function, particularly if hereditary macular dystrophy is suspected.
   
3. **Follow-Up:**
   - Schedule follow-up appointments to monitor any progression of retinal changes or emergence of new symptoms.
   
4. **Patient Education:**
   - Educate the patient about potential symptoms of retinal detachment or other visual disturbances and advise prompt consultation if these occur.

**Conclusions:**

This retinal fundus image suggests potential macular and peripheral retinal changes that may be indicative of a hereditary or acquired retinal condition. Further detailed evaluation and monitoring are recommended to ensure early identification and management of any progressive retinal pathology.

Section 1 Congenital dysplasia of optic nerve and optic disc  1. Congenital optic nerve and optic disc agenesis: There are often different clinical manifestations due to different degrees of developmental abnormalities, and visual function also has different effects. Light vision can be normal, and serious vision can lead to no light perception.
Chapter 1 Fluorescence fundus angiography  5. Abnormal fundus fluorescence: (4)Retrofilling: When a branch artery is blocked, the normal capillary network adjacent to it can flow in the reverse direction, filling the distal end of the blocked arteriole, but the main trunk is not filled with fluorescence. This phenomenon is called retrograde filling.
Section III	central exudative chorioretinopathy: During the recovery period, the bleeding and exudation gradually absorbed, and finally the choroidal neovascular membrane was gradually replaced by organizing scars.
COBBLESTONE DEGENERATION  EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY: This is a degenerative process of unknown etiology.

- **Date of Examination:** [Current Date]
- **Photograph Description:** Retinal fundus image provided for analysis.

### Examination Findings:

#### 1. Optic Disc:
- **Observation:** The optic disc is not distinctly visible in the provided image, making it difficult to assess its characteristics such as color, margins, and presence of optic nerve head swelling or pallor.
- **Impression:** Unable to evaluate the optic disc due to image limitations.

#### 2. Macula:
- **Observation:** The macula region appears to have no distinct features discernible from the image provided. There is no clear view of the fovea or surrounding details.
- **Impression:** Detailed evaluation of the macula for conditions such as macular hole or degeneration is not feasible due to the image quality and visibility.

#### 3. Retinal Blood Vessels:
- **Observation:** Retinal blood vessels are visible but not sharply defined, and it is challenging to assess their caliber, course, and crossing changes.
- **Impression:**
  - No clear signs of arteriolar narrowing, venous dilation, or arteriovenous crossing anomalies are evident from the image.
  - The image quality limits the assessment of functional or organic vascular changes, which could be indicative of systemic conditions such as hypertensive retinopathy.

#### 4. Retinal Background:
- **Observation:** The retinal background appears uniformly red and homogeneous with no distinct features like hemorrhages, exudates, or cotton-wool spots observed.
- **Impression:**
  - There are no signs of retinal edema, hemorrhages, or other pathologies commonly associated with retinal vascular or inflammatory diseases.

#### 5. Cup-to-Disc Ratio:
- **Observation:** As the optic disc is not adequately visualized, the cup-to-disc ratio cannot be assessed.
- **Impression:** Unable to evaluate the cup-to-disc ratio.

### Summary:
The provided retinal fundus image presents significant limitations in clarity and detail, impeding a thorough and accurate ophthalmic evaluation. The optic disc and macula are not clearly discernible, and the retinal blood vessels and background lack the definition necessary for an in-depth assessment.

### Recommendations:
- **Further Imaging:** It is recommended to obtain higher resolution fundus photographs or utilize additional imaging modalities such as OCT (Optical Coherence Tomography) or fluorescein angiography for a more comprehensive assessment.
- **Clinical Correlation:** Correlate clinical findings with patient history and symptoms. If the patient presents with vision loss, metamorphopsia, or other visual disturbances, further detailed examination is warranted.
- **Follow-up:** Continuous monitoring and reevaluation post-imaging to identify any progressive changes or diagnose any underlying conditions.

Section 7 Macular hole  1. Idiopathic macular hole: Vitrectomy was performed (peeling the internal limiting membrane and removing the vitreous traction on the fovea). Gas and liquid exchanges were performed during the operation, and prone position was taken after the operation. Biological adjuvants such as autologous serum, transforming growth factor-B, or autologous platelet concentrate can also be applied to the tear surface during surgery, which may promote tear healing.
IDIOPATHIC MACULAR HOLE  ASSOCIATED CLINICALSIGNS: The Watzke-Allen sign is the patient's description of discontinuance in the center of a thin slit beam shone over the fovea.
section I	vascular disease  4. Fundus changes in pregnancy induced hypertension syndrome: The most common and earliest fundus changes are functional spasm and coarctation of the retinal arterioles, starting with localized segmental coarctation and then progressing to uniform and generalized coarctation. The ratio of arteries and veins can change from normal 2:3 to 1:2 or even 1:4. As blood pressure continues to rise, blood vessels move from functional contraction to organic hardening. For example, those with hypertension before pregnancy, the hardening is more obvious. Arterial stenosis, enhanced reflection, and some of them can still see the phenomenon of arterial and venous crossing. Due to severe spasm and constriction of the arteries, the blood-retinal barrier is damaged, retinal capillaries are dilate, resulting in retinal edema, hemorrhage, and cotton-like plaque formation or macula star-like exudation. Or cause capillary occlusion, which can occur in the macula area or the periphery of the retina, causing vision loss. It can also be caused by severe central retinal artery spasm secondary to optic nerve atrophy, resulting in reduced vision. In severe cases, papilledema may occur, or acute optic nerve ischemic lesions may occur due to impaired blood supply to the optic nerve in the cribriform plate area, resulting in loss or loss of vision. In severe cases, serous retinal detachment can occur. The detachment is often bilateral, spherical, and is mostly located below the retina, or can affect the entire retina. There is fluid under the retina, and exudate can come from the retina and choroid, or from the choroid alone. Because high blood pressure damages the choroidal capillaries and the pigment epithelium above them, the choroidal vessels can also exude or occlude, and fluid enters the subretinal space. Retinal detachment has a good prognosis and does not require surgery. It can reposition itself within a few weeks after delivery, and vision recovers, leaving behind pigmentation and depigmentation, and forming old Elshnig spots.

### Detailed Retinal Fundus Image Report

#### Optic Disc
- **Appearance**: The optic disc appears to be slightly elevated and is yellowish-white in color.
- **Margins**: The margins are somewhat blurred, lacking sharp demarcation, which might suggest mild papilledema.
- **Size**: The optic disc size seems normal, with no indications of the Double Ring Sign that is characteristic of congenital optic disc anomalies.
- **Cup-to-Disc Ratio**: The cup-to-disc ratio cannot be determined precisely from the image but does not appear grossly abnormal.
- **Observations**: Blood vessels emerge radially from the disc as expected. No signs of optic disc agenesis or severe optic disc pallor were observed.

#### Macula
- **Appearance**: The macula appears darker and less reflective than the surrounding retinal tissue.
- **Foveal Reflex**: The foveal reflex is not distinctly visible; this can be a normal variation or indicate pathological changes.
- **Observations**: There are no apparent signs of macular edema or hard exudates around the macula region. Signs consistent with conditions like chloroquine or hydroxychloroquine retinopathy are not distinctly visible on this fundus image.

#### Retinal Blood Vessels
- **Arteries and Veins**: The major retinal blood vessels are visible, and their distribution appears consistent with normal anatomy.
- **Vessel Caliber**: There is no noticeable narrowing or increased tortuosity of the retinal vessels, suggesting no significant sign of retinal vascular obstructive disease.
- **Vascular Changes**: There are no abnormal vascular anastomoses visible, and no signs of branch retinal vein or artery occlusion were observed.

#### Retinal Background
- **Appearance**: The background retinal tissue is uniformly orange-red, indicating healthy choroidal vasculature.
- **Retinal Pigmentation**: There is no abnormal pigmentation noted. 
- **Pathological Findings**: There are no visible drusen, hemorrhages, or cotton wool spots which are indicative of underlying retinal or systemic conditions.

#### Cup-to-Disc Ratio
- **Estimated Ratio**: While a precise ratio cannot be determined from this image alone, the cup does not appear to take up an abnormal portion of the optic disc, suggesting a roughly average cup-to-disc ratio. Ideally, more precise measurement tools are needed for an accurate assessment.

#### Conclusion
Overall, the retinal fundus image reveals a generally healthy retinal appearance with no definitive signs of serious pathology. The slightly blurred optic disc margins may warrant follow-up to rule out conditions such as mild papilledema or early signs of glaucoma. The macula shows no immediate signs of pathological changes, and retinal blood vessels appear normal with no signs of occlusion or abnormal anastomosis. Further diagnostic evaluations, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) or electroretinography, may be considered for a more thorough assessment.

**Retinal Fundus Image Report**

---

**Patient Information:**
- Image Reference: A
- Diagnosis Reference: Astrocytic Hamartoma

---

**Optic Disc:**
- The optic disc appears slightly elevated with a creamy white lesion, indicating the presence of a possible astrocytic hamartoma. This is consistent with the associated clinical signs which occasionally produce vitreous hemorrhage and subretinal hemorrhage. The disc margins are obscure in the superior region, likely due to the lesion.

**Macula:**
- The macula area appears relatively less affected. There is no obvious degeneration or atrophy noted, which suggests the central vision is likely intact. The central location of these lesions typically implies that the condition might not be profoundly impacting macular function early in its process, but continuous monitoring is advised.

**Retinal Blood Vessels:**
- Blood vessels, especially superior to the disc, appear to be slightly obscured by the lesion. There is minimal tortuosity observed, and no significant hemorrhage along the vascular arcades, but close attention should be given to potential future hemorrhages as indicated by the nature of the astrocytic hamartoma. The overall caliber of the vessels appears normal.

**Retinal Background:**
- The retinal background does not show extensive abnormalities. The general color and pigmentation seem consistent without widespread pigmentary changes or dystrophy. However, there is a mild localized hyperpigmentation near the lesion, suggesting a possible reactive process.

**Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
- The cup-to-disc ratio is challenging to assess accurately due to the distortion created by the astrocytic hamartoma. From the visible part, the ratio seems within normal limits, but the compressive effects of the lesion need to be regularly evaluated to monitor potential changes in optic nerve head contour.

---

**Clinical Correlation/Recommendations:**
- The observed findings are highly suggestive of an astrocytic hamartoma, consistent with the clinical descriptions provided, particularly due to the characteristic creamy white lesion on the optic disc.
- Regular follow-up is essential to monitor for complications such as vitreous hemorrhage or progression towards retinal detachment.
- Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) may be recommended for further evaluation of choroidal circulation and ruling out any accompanying choroidal pathology.
- Immediate referral to an ophthalmologist is advised for a comprehensive examination and to discuss potential intervention strategies if symptoms or lesions progress.
  
---

**Conclusion:**
- The fundus image demonstrates findings indicative of astrocytic hamartoma. Given the current state, vigilance in monitoring and follow-up checks are paramount to ensure timely management of any emerging complications.

---

**Note:**
- Further diagnostics including fluorescein angiography and possibly OCT imaging could provide additional insights into the structural and vascular implications of the hamartoma.

ASTROCYTIC HAMARTOMA  ASSOCIATED CLINICAL SIGNS: Ocular: Occasionally, may produce vitreous hemorrhage, vitreous seeding, subretinal hemorrhage, or retinal detachment.
section I	vascular disease  2. Fundus changes in Cushing syndrome: [Ocular manifestations] The ocular manifestations of Cushing syndrome include changes in the external eye, fundus and intraocular pressure.
Section II	Choroidal dystrophy  1. Central halo choroidal dystrophy: At any time, the lesions were bilateral, symmetrical, confined to the macula, and were not related to other lesions.
CHOROIDAL MELANOCYTOMA  IMPORTANT CLINICAL SIGNS: It is usually unilateral.
Chapter 2 Indocyanine green angiography  1. A brief history of indocyanine green angiography: Our country began to introduce this technology in 1995. Through clinical application, it has been found that ICGA is of great significance for displaying normal choroidal circulation structures and the diagnosis and research of retinal and choroidal diseases.
Section III	central exudative chorioretinopathy: During the recovery period, the bleeding and exudation gradually absorbed, and finally the choroidal neovascular membrane was gradually replaced by organizing scars.
Section II	Choroidal dystrophy  4. No choroid disease: Because the macula is affected later, patients can maintain good central vision until the advanced stage of the disease. Female carriers usually maintain normal vision throughout their lives.
Section II	Choroidal dystrophy  1. Central halo choroidal dystrophy: At any time, the lesions were bilateral, symmetrical, confined to the macula, and were not related to other lesions.
JUVENILE X-LINKED RETINOSCHISIS  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT: There is no treatment for the macular aspects of the disease.
CHOROIDEREMIA  CLINICAL SIGNS: Early in the disease process, fundus appearance in the affected males is a "salt-and-pepper" retinal pigment epithelial mottling at the equator and the posterior pole. Below the retinal pigment epithelial mottling, theunderlying choroid may appear clinically normal, but fluorescein angiography may show a patchy loss of choroidal vasculature.
Section 3 Spot Retinopathy  2. Yellow and white spotted fundus: 1. Yellow spots are usually located at the posterior pole around the macula or even at the equator. Yellow-white spots can be seen with unclear boundaries. There are also linear fish tails. Oval atrophy of the macular area can be complicated. Yellow spots and maculopathy are now believed to be the same disease. It is also called the Stargardt-Yellow Spot Eye Group. Yellow spots are lipofuscin deposits in pigment epithelial cells.
Section 1 Traumatic chorioretinopathy  3. Choroidal rupture and bleeding: Like the mechanism for forming retinal concussions, external forces can also impact the choroid to cause choroid rupture. The fundus shows yellow-white stripes, which are arc-shaped and concave facing the optic disc. The stripes can be long or short, and the number can be large or small. The author once saw 1 case with as many as 5 to 6 streaks. Hemorrhage is often complicated at the striations, and the striations are covered, or even bleed into the vitreous body. Late repair, especially through rupture and fibrosis of the macula, permanently and severely impaired vision.
Section III	Hereditary macular disease  4. Pattern macular dystrophy: Color vision, dark adaptation, electroretinogram: normal.
Section III	Hereditary macular disease  4. Pattern macular dystrophy: Visual field: Except for a slight decrease in visual acuity in the macula area, the rest is normal.
CILIORETINAL ARTERY OBSTRUCTION(OCCLUSION)  CLINICAL SIGNS: Visual acuity: Generally, there is a history of acute, unilateral, painless visual field loss occurring over several seconds. Approximately 10% of those affected have a history of transient visual loss (amaurosis fugax) in the affected eye prior to the central retinal arterial obstruction.

**Examination Findings:**

**1. Optic Disc:**
   - The optic disc exhibits pronounced edema characterized by blurred disc margins.
   - The optic disc appears elevated and hyperemic indicating congestion.
   - There is evidence of vascular engorgement around the disc, which is suggestive of increased intracranial pressure consistent with papilledema.
   - No pallor or signs of optic atrophy are noted at the current stage.
   - Differential diagnosis consideration includes papilledema, which can result from various conditions discussed below.

**2. Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
   - The cup-to-disc ratio is difficult to determine due to the obscured margins and edema but appears significantly reduced, indicating potential elevated intracranial pressure.

**3. Retinal Blood Vessels:**
   - The retinal blood vessels emerge from the swollen optic disc and appear tortuous and dilated.
   - No evidence of hemorrhage is observed.
   - There are no signs of vessel narrowing or occlusion that might suggest retinal artery or vein occlusion.

**4. Macula:**
   - Due to the central location and the shadow seen, there is an unclear depiction of the macula.
   - No signs of central halo or macular degeneration are noted in the given image.
   - The retinal tissue around the macula appears normal without significant atrophy or abnormal pigmentation.

**5. Retinal Background:**
   - The retinal background shows an orange-red hue consistent with a healthy retinal pigment epithelium.
   - There is no evident choroidal pathology or mass lesions like choroidal melanoma or retinoblastoma in the present view.
   - There is no evidence of choroidal dystrophy or vitreoretinal abnormalities.

---

**Impression:**

The retinal fundus image shows significant optic disc edema, a key feature of papilledema. This could be associated with increased intracranial pressure potentially resulting from several etiologies such as:
- Idiopathic intracranial hypertension
- Intracranial tumors causing mass effect
- Intracranial venous sinus thrombosis
- Inflammatory or toxic lesions impacting intracranial pressure

Given the differential diagnosis possibilities, further investigation including neuroimaging (MRI or CT scan of the brain) and lumbar puncture (for measuring cerebrospinal fluid pressure) is recommended to ascertain the underlying cause. Comprehensive history and systemic examination are crucial to guide appropriate management and treatment plan.

---

**Recommendations:**
- Urgent neuro-ophthalmology consultation.
- Comprehensive systemic and neurological assessment.
- Immediate neuroimaging to rule out space-occupying lesions.
- Monitoring of visual function through clinical follow-up.

EXUDATIVE RETINAL DETACHMENT  IMPORTANT CLINICAL SIGNS: The subretinal fluid generally shifts to the most gravity-dependent position with changes in the patient's head position.
Section 3 Common abnormal signs of fundus  2. Retinal and choroidal hemorrhage: 2. Intraretinal hemorrhages are divided into superficial and deep hemorrhages.
CHORIORETINAL COLOBOMA  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT: No treatment is necessary unless retinal detachment occurs .
RETINAL BREAK OR TEAR  IMPORTANT CLINICAL SIGNS: Retinal dialysis: Disinsertion of the retina from the pars plana at the ora serrata; most often inferotemporal; superonasal is virtually pathognomonic for trauma.
Section 1 Rhegmatogenous retinal detachment: Retinal detachment with automatic reattachment is occasionally seen due to the small tear and slow development of proliferative retinopathy, which reattaches spontaneously without treatment. Often, the medical history lasts for several years, and the retina in all or the affected part of the fundus loses transparency, irregular pigmentation occurs, and white lines under the retina proliferate.

- **Peripheral Retina:** No significant abnormalities such as retinal tears, detachments, or lattice degeneration are observed.

#### Conclusion and Recommendations:
- **Diagnosis:** The retinal fundus image does not show signs of acute or severe pathology. Some irregularities in the macular region suggest possible early degenerative changes or solar maculopathy.
- **Follow-Up:** Recommend regular follow-up examinations to monitor the macular area for any progression of changes.
- **Management Plan:** No immediate interventions required. However, patient education regarding UV light protection could be beneficial to prevent potential solar maculopathy.

#### Differential Diagnosis to Consider:
- **Solar Maculopathy:** Given the shadow in the macular region, solar maculopathy should be considered as a differential.
- **Macular Degeneration:** Early signs of macular degeneration may also present with similar features and should be ruled out.

Further detailed clinical examination and correlation with patient history and symptoms are advised to make a comprehensive diagnosis and management plan.

### Retinal Fundus Examination Report

#### Patient Information:
- **Eye Examined:** Not specified
- **Date of Examination:** Not specified

#### Observations:

1. **Optic Disc:**
   - **Appearance:** The optic disc appears edematous with poorly defined edges, indicating possible disc edema. The disc color appears lighter than usual.
   - **Blood Vessels:** There is dilation and anastomosis of the blood vessels over the disc.

2. **Macula:**
   - **Observation:** The macular region appears to be less distinctly detailed due to the overall appearance of the retina. No clear signs of macular edema or pigmentary changes observed in this image.

3. **Retinal Blood Vessels:**
   - **Vascular Features:** There is marked dilation of the retinal blood vessels, which converge at the optic disc. The vessels appear to be tortuous but without significant hemorrhages present.
   - **Abnormalities:** There is no evidence of dot-blot hemorrhages, exudates, or cotton-wool spots in this image.

4. **Retinal Background:**
   - **Color and Texture:** The retinal background is predominantly orange-yellow with diffuse reddish discoloration due to widespread vascular changes and dilation. No distinct pigmentation patterns or lesions observed.
   - **Pathological Signs:** The overall appearance may suggest retinal edema or inflammation.

5. **Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
   - **Estimation:** Due to the blurred and edematous nature of the optic disc, an accurate estimation of the cup-to-disc ratio is not possible from this image.

#### Differential Diagnosis:
- **Leber's Congenital Amaurosis:** While not addressed directly by the image, this may present with a similar congenital retinal degeneration phenotype.
- **Albinism:** Typically exhibits features such as hypopigmentation, foveal hypoplasia, and vascular dilations. The current image does not provide sufficient evidence for hypopigmentation characteristic of ocular albinism.
- **Other Considerations:** Potential differential diagnosis for retinal and disc edema could include conditions like ocular ischemic syndrome, hypertensive or diabetic retinopathy, and inflammatory conditions such as optic neuritis.

#### Conclusion:
The retinal image shows significant optic disc edema with associated vascular changes. The dilated and tortuous blood vessels with unclear disc margins are indicative of potential underlying pathologies which require further clinical correlation and possibly additional imaging techniques and diagnostic tests to establish a comprehensive diagnosis.

#### Recommendations:
- **Follow-Up Tests:** Additional imaging such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) and Fluorescein Angiography (FA) to further assess the retinal layers and blood flow.
- **Clinical Examination:** Detailed slit-lamp examination and documentation of visual acuity and visual fields.
- **Referral:** Consider referral to a retinal specialist for further evaluation and management.

Section III	Retinal vascular inflammatory disease  4. Frosty dendritic retinal vasculitis: Frosted branch retinal vasculitis, or frosted retinal periphlebitis, was first reported by Ito in 1976, and has since been reported in other countries. It is named because it appears frost-like white on the blood vessel walls and exudes like winter white frost hanging on the branches.
Section 2 Complex rhegmatogenous retinal detachment  5. Congenital choroidal defect with retinal detachment: (2) Retinal tears
Section 1 Congenital abnormal diseases of the vitreous body  1. Permanent vitreous artery: [Treatment and Prognosis] Generally, it does not affect vision and requires no treatment.
Section II	non-infectious chorioretinitis  3. Intermediate uveitis: Using binocular indirect ophthalmoscope and scleral compression to observe the periphery of the fundus, vitreous inflammatory cells and inflammatory cells gather into snowballs; vitreous inflammatory cells may vary in severity, which may make the fundus unclear. At the flat part of the ciliary body and the periphery of the retina, there are disseminated grayish-yellow exudation foci, with white sheaths in the peripheral retinal blood vessels; when the inflammation is relieved, the exudation scarring and forms grayish-white atrophy spots, which may be accompanied by pigment disorder; The exudation spreads to both sides, forming snow bank-like changes, which is pathologically a proliferative lesion; in the later stage, it is an organized membrane, and the contraction of the organized membrane produces traction retinal and choroid detachment; The organizing membrane carries new blood vessels, which is a potential cause of retinal hemorrhage and vitreous hemorrhage.
Section 3 Spot Retinopathy  1. Hyaluronic warts: 1. Typical or exudative drusen occurs in AMD. Mostly eyes. Located between the basal membrane of the RPE and the endoglial membrane of the Bruch membrane. Yellow in color, slightly raised, and varying in size. Most common in the macula. It can also be seen in other parts. It is often located in the center or paracentral of the macula, forming a cluster of symmetrical eyes. Size, shape, distribution, color, quantity and hardness change over time. It can appear as small yellow dots called hard drusen, or it can appear as large, gray-white disk-like structures that are indistinguishable from detachment of the pigment epithelium, called soft drusen. Calcification can occur. The drusen can also disappear, leaving behind a map-like atrophy of the RPE.
Section 2 Exudative macular degeneration  1. Clinical manifestations: (3)Hemorrhage in the macula area can be dark purple between the RPE and the choroid; red between the RPE and the neuroepithelial layer; it can also form preretinal hemorrhage and even enter the vitreous cavity. Hemoglobin can decompose into yellow hemosiderin over time.
NONPROLIFERATIVE DIABETIC RETINOPATHY  DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Retinal vein occlusion (branch orcentral)
RBTINOPATHY OF PREMATURITY  DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION: The retina is completely vascularized.
section I	retinal degenerative disease  1. Primary retinitis pigmentosa: (2)Retinal blood vessels stenosis and thinning: especially arterial blood vessels. In the late stage, the arterial vessels are extremely thin, but there is no white line formation or white sheath wrapping.

**4. Retinal Background:**
- The general background of the retina appears to be uniform.
- No signs of hemorrhages, exudates, or choroidal detachment are observed.
- There is an absence of drusen or other degenerative changes.
- There are scattered, small, whitish-yellow deposits mainly in the peripheral retinal areas, which might suggest early signs of retinal or choroidal disturbance but are not prominent.

**5. Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
- The cup-to-disc ratio is approximately 0.2 to 0.3, which is within the normal range.
- This suggests a normal optic nerve head with no signs of glaucomatous changes.

**Impressions:**
- This retinal fundus examination presents a relatively normal appearance consistent with that of a healthy eye.
- The clinical findings rule out common abnormalities such as significant macular disorders, retinal edema, or retinal vein occlusion.
- The small, scattered deposits should be monitored over time to rule out early stages of pigmentary retinal conditions, but they are not immediately concerning based on current presentation.

**Recommendations:**
- Routine follow-up eye exams to monitor for any change in retinal appearance.
- If the patient reports any visual disturbances, a more detailed examination, potentially including optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescence fundus angiography, may be warranted to assess for subtle changes not apparent in the fundus photograph alone.

---

**Conclusion:**
The left eye's retinal fundus appears within normal limits with no significant abnormalities noted. Regular monitoring is suggested to ensure ongoing ocular health.

   - **Color:** The color is relatively normal, indicating a healthy optic disc without significant pallor or hyperemia.
   - **Blood Vessels:** The blood vessels at the disc appear normal, without any signs of abnormal dilation or anastomosis.

2. **Macula:**
   - **Appearance:** The macula seems somewhat blurred but there is no evident sign of macular edema, exudates, or hemorrhage. The details of the fovea are not clearly distinguishable, suggesting a need for further imaging or testing.
   - **Pathology:** No specific lesion, such as a macular hole or "bull's eye" maculopathy, noted.

3. **Retinal Blood Vessels:**
   - **Arteries and Veins:** The retinal blood vessels appear within normal limits concerning both their width and course. They exhibit a uniform caliber without signs of attenuation or vessel tortuosity.
   - **Crossings:** There are no significant AV crossings suggestive of arteriovenous nicking. No microaneurysms or neovascularization observed.
   - **Pathology:** No visible signs of hemorrhages or hard exudates along the retinal vessels.

4. **Retinal Background:**
   - **General Appearance:** The retinal background displays a healthy color indicative of proper perfusion. There are no obvious signs of retinal detachment, pigmentary changes, or significant atrophy.
   - **Pathology:** The absence of any cotton wool spots or drusen suggests a lack of acute or chronic ischemic changes and age-related macular degeneration.

5. **Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
   - **Estimation:** The cup-to-disc ratio appears to be within the normal range (approximately 0.3), although a more precise measurement could be beneficial for a comprehensive glaucoma risk assessment.
   - **Noticeable Features:** There is no evident cupping or deepening, which typically suggests an absence of advanced glaucoma.

#### Conclusion:
The current fundus image of the left eye seems relatively normal with well-defined optic disc margins, normal retinal blood vessels, and background. The macula, although slightly blurred, does not exhibit any acute changes that call for immediate intervention. The cup-to-disc ratio is within normal limits, and there is no significant pathology that may suggest the presence of conditions such as disc edema, retinal tears, or significant hereditary macular diseases.

### Recommendations:
1. **Follow-Up Imaging:** Consider Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) to better evaluate the macula and optic disc in higher resolution.
2. **Regular Review:** Schedule periodic follow-ups for retinal health monitoring, especially to assess any progressive changes in the macula or optic disc.
3. **Patient Symptoms:** Obtain a detailed history to check for symptoms such as vision loss, floaters, or flashes of light which may necessitate further diagnostic testing.

#### References:
- No immediate treatment or intervention needed based on the current findings. 
- Further evaluation might be required if there are additional symptoms or risk factors present.
  
**Note:** Correlation with clinical history and other diagnostic tests is essential for a comprehensive evaluation.

#### Optic Disc
- **Observation**: The optic disc is not visible in the provided image. Since the image does not show the optic disc region, a detailed analysis of its characteristics and cup-to-disc ratio cannot be performed.

#### Macula
- **Observation**: The macula appears to be centered in the image. There are no distinct features suggesting macular edema, hemorrhage, or significant degeneration.
- **Interpretation**: The macular region does not show signs of age-related macular degeneration or other macular dystrophies based on the provided image.

#### Retinal Blood Vessels
- **Observation**: The retinal blood vessels are distributed across the retinal surface with normal branching patterns. There appear to be no signs of abnormal vessel formation, leakage, or hemorrhage.
- **Interpretation**: The retinal vasculature is within normal limits without proliferative changes or obvious vascular abnormalities. There is no indication of diabetic retinopathy or retinal vein occlusion in this segment.

#### Retinal Background
- **Observation**: The retinal background is uniform in color with some areas of increased reflectivity. There are no signs of drusen, pigment changes, or scar tissue formation evident in the image.
- **Interpretation**: The uniform appearance and lack of drusen deposits suggest that there are no significant changes related to dry or non-exudative age-related macular degeneration. No evidence of scarring suggests the absence of significant chorioretinopathy or previous retinal detachments in this image portion.

#### Cup-to-Disc Ratio
- **Observation**: Since the optic disc is not visible in the provided image, the cup-to-disc ratio cannot be assessed.
- **Interpretation**: Not applicable due to the absence of the optic disc in the image.

#### Additional Observations
- **White Reflex (Leukocoria)**: There is no evidence in the image of leukocoria that could suggest retinoblastoma or other significant pediatric retinal abnormalities.
- **Pattern Dystrophy**: There are no visible features suggestive of pattern dystrophy in the macular region.
- **Fluorescence**: The examination for strong fluorescence indicative of abnormal vessels cannot be conducted with the provided image modality.

---

### Summary
The retinal image provided does not show any acute pathological changes such as hemorrhages, exudates, abnormal vasculature, or significant macular degeneration. However, the absence of the optic disc precludes a full assessment of the optic nerve and cup-to-disc ratio. The retinal blood vessels and macula appear within normal limits, and there are no signs suggestive of significant retinal dystrophies or degenerations based on this single image snapshot.

---

**Recommendations**: 
1. A comprehensive retinal fundus examination including images of the optic disc should be obtained.
2. Further diagnostic tests such as optical coherence tomography (OCT) and fluorescein angiography could provide additional insights if there is clinical suspicion of retinal pathology.
3. Routine follow-up and monitoring as indicated by the patient's clinical context and history.

### Retinal Fundus Image Report

#### 1. Optic Disc
- **Appearance**: The optic disc appears well-defined with a slightly elevated margin, indicating a potentially normal appearance.
- **Color**: The optic disc is observed to have a normal pinkish hue, which reflects a healthy optic nerve and proper blood flow.
- **Cup-to-Disc Ratio**: The cup-to-disc ratio does not appear to be enlarged, suggesting no obvious signs of glaucomatous changes.

#### 2. Macula
- **Location and Clarity**: The macula is centrally located and is discernable in the image.
- **Contextual Observations**: There is a slight darkening in the foveal area which could be normal or might suggest early macular changes like a macular hole at an early stage (Stage II) but requires further investigation.
- **Possible Indications**: No obvious exudates or hemorrhages are seen around the macula, ruling out active diabetic maculopathy or central exudative chorioretinopathy.

#### 3. Retinal Blood Vessels
- **Arteries and Veins**: The arteries and veins appear to have a normal coloration and are of typical size, with no signs of narrowing or tortuosity.
- **Caliber**: No evident beading or dilation, indicating no active hypertensive retinopathy or diabetic changes.
- **Pathology**: There are no apparent cotton wool spots or hard exudates along the vessels, which are often seen in conditions like diabetic retinopathy.
  
#### 4. Retinal Background
- **Color and Texture**: The retinal background is uniformly orange with consistent pigmentation, indicating no signs of retinal degeneration or lipemia retinalis.
- **Hemorrhages**: There are no signs of intraretinal, preretinal, or subretinal hemorrhages.
- **Exudates**: Lack of observable hard or soft exudates suggests a non-inflamed and intact retina.

#### 5. Cup-to-Disc Ratio
- **Measurement**: The cup-to-disc ratio appears within normal limits, estimated to be less than 0.5.
- **Implication**: This ratio does not indicate glaucomatous changes which are usually associated with an increased ratio.

#### Additional Observations
- **Absence of Detachment**: There is no indication of retinal detachment, as no pooling or shifts of retinal layers are observed.
- **Peripheral Retina**: Although not clearly visible in this image, there is no indication of retinoschisis or peripheral degeneration based on the given visual range.

### Conclusion
The analyzed retinal fundus image presents a seemingly healthy retina with normal optic disc appearance, macular location, and retinal blood vessels. The slight darkening in the macular area should be observed over time to rule out early-stage macular holes. Further examinations such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) are recommended for precise analysis, especially for subtle macular changes.

### Recommendations
- **Follow-up Examination**: A follow-up examination is necessary to monitor any changes in the macula and optic disc.
- **OCT Scan**: An OCT scan is suggested to more accurately analyze the macula and the optic nerve head for any microstructural abnormalities.
- **Regular Monitoring**: Regular monitoring is advisable for early detection of any progressive conditions like diabetic or hypertensive retinopathy.

**Retinal Image Report**

**1. Optic Disc:**
   - The optic disc appears blurred due to the overall quality of the image, making it difficult to assess the margins and color. However, the optic nerve head seems slightly elevated.

**2. Macula:**
   - The macula is not clearly distinguishable in this image. Given the overall appearance, detailed evaluation for conditions like macular holes or changes characteristic of age-related macular degeneration is limited.

**3. Retinal Blood Vessels:**
   - The retinal blood vessels appear moderately dilated, with a few visible major vessels. Tortuosity and any signs of nonproliferative diabetic retinopathy cannot be precisely determined from this image.

**4. Retinal Background:**
   - The retinal background has a reddish hue and lacks clear differentiation. There are no visible signs of drusen or other typical pathologies indicative of age-related changes.

**5. Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
   - Due to the unclear depiction of the optic cup, the cup-to-disc ratio cannot be accurately evaluated in this image.

**Conclusion:**
   - The image quality is not optimal for a precise diagnostic evaluation. Clinical correlation with visual symptoms, history, and additional imaging is recommended. Further assessment with a detailed fundoscopic examination and high-resolution imaging may be necessary to rule out potential conditions such as macular holes, diabetic retinopathy, or age-related macular changes.

## Retinal Image Analysis Report

### 1. Optic Disc
- **Appearance:** The optic disc appears pale and blurred, indicative of potential optic nerve damage or circulatory issues.
- **Margins:** The margins of the optic disc are not well-defined, suggestive of papilledema or optic disc swelling.
- **Cup-to-Disc Ratio:** Due to the overexposure and blurring at the optic disc, accurate assessment of cup-to-disc ratio is difficult. However, the overall physiologic cup appears relatively small, possibly indicative of increased intracranial pressure.

### 2. Macula
- **Condition:** The macula seems moderately affected with some overlying hemorrhages and exudates. The foveal light reflex is not discernible, indicating potential foveal involvement.
- **Observations:** Macular edema or signs of diabetic retinopathy could be present, given the surrounding hemorrhages and exudates.

### 3. Retinal Blood Vessels
- **Arteries:** The retinal arteries are relatively thin and moderately sclerotic.
- **Veins:** There appears to be venous engorgement and tortuosity, particularly in the area adjacent to the optic disc. This suggests branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO).
- **Crossings:** At the arteriovenous crossings, there is evidence of venous compression and possible arteriovenous nicking.

### 4. Retinal Background
- **Hemorrhages:** Extensive intraretinal hemorrhages are observed, predominantly near the optic disc and extending towards the macula. These hemorrhages are indicative of BRVO.
- **Exudates:** Hard exudates are present adjacent to the hemorrhages, which could be due to vascular leakage commonly seen in BRVO or diabetic retinopathy.
- **Other Findings:** No significant signs of choroidal dystrophy or retinal detachments are evident. The presence of lipid deposits and hemorrhages suggests chronic vascular occlusive events.

### 5. Differential Diagnosis
- **Branch Retinal Vein Occlusion (BRVO):** The distribution of hemorrhages and venous tortuosity strongly suggest BRVO.
- **Hypertensive Retinopathy:** The sclerotic changes in the arteries and arteriovenous crossing changes align with hypertensive retinopathy, which could be a contributing factor to BRVO.
- **Diabetic Retinopathy:** While some features overlap, the primary vascular changes and hemorrhages are more consistent with BRVO.

### Conclusion
The retinal image primarily shows signs consistent with branch retinal vein occlusion (BRVO). The optic disc swellings, venous tortuosity, and extensive hemorrhages around the disc with accompanying exudates signify venous occlusion. There may be underlying hypertensive vascular changes contributing to the condition. Follow-up with fluorescein angiography would help confirm BRVO and exclude other differentials like diabetic retinopathy.

Further Recommendations:
- Comprehensive ophthalmologic examination to follow up on findings.
- Systemic investigations for hypertension and diabetes.
- Potential referral for retinal specialist consultation for possible laser therapy or intravitreal injections to reduce macular edema and exudate formation.

Combined Texts:
Retinal vein occlusion in section 1  2. Branch retinal vein occlusion: Branch retinal vein occlusion is the occlusion of one or more branch veins. The pathogenic factors are not similar to CRVO. BRVO mostly occurs at the intersection of arteries and veins. Anatomic studies have shown that the arteries and veins have a common sheath, and the veins are often compressed or bent by small arteries. Therefore, it can be imagined that in the case of hypertension and arteriosclerosis of the arterioles, compression of the arterioles can lead to stenosis of the venous lumen, disturbance of blood flow, damage to the vascular endothelium, and thrombosis, thus causing BRVO.

### Detailed Report for Retinal Fundus Image

#### Optic Disc
- **Appearance**: The optic disc is not clearly visible in the provided image. This might be due to the positioning of the camera or the extent of other pathological findings that obscure the optic disc area.
- **Cup-to-Disc Ratio**: As the optic disc is not visible, it is not possible to assess the cup-to-disc ratio.

#### Macula
- **Appearance**: The macular area is not clearly distinguishable due to the extensive pathological changes observed throughout the fundus. Although macular abnormalities are not specifically noted, the overall disturbance may affect the macula as well.
  
#### Retinal Blood Vessels
- **Observations**: Blood vessels appear relatively attenuated but their structure is mostly preserved. There does not appear to be significant tortuosity or hemorrhage, but the clarity is reduced due to widespread fundal changes.

#### Retinal Background
- **General Background**: The retinal background exhibits multiple areas of degeneration characterized by white, well-circumscribed lesions. These lesions are consistent with cobblestone degeneration, which is a degenerative process affecting the peripheral retina. Cobblestone degeneration typically presents as whitish patches of retinal thinning with adjacent pigment changes.
- **Specific Findings**:
  - **White Lesions**: Multiple large, well-defined, whitish areas suggesting cobblestone degeneration.
  - **Pigmented Areas**: Some darker regions of pigmentation can be observed, which may represent areas of chorioretinal atrophy or other degenerative changes associated with myopic degeneration.
  
#### Pathological Findings:
- **Degenerative Myopia**: The findings are consistent with degenerative myopia, a condition more prevalent in women that often presents with diffuse degenerative changes in the fundus, including cobblestone degeneration.
- **Cobblestone Degeneration**: Characterized by the presence of multiple, pale, and well-demarcated areas in the peripheral retina, as seen in the image. These are areas of retinal thinning and atrophy.
  
#### Conclusion
The retinal fundus image demonstrates significant degenerative changes characterized by cobblestone degeneration. There are no clear indications of associated pathologies such as choroidal metastasis or macular holes based on this image alone. The optic disc and macula areas are obscured, and detailed evaluation of these areas is not feasible from this image. The primary diagnosis appears to center on degenerative myopia with characteristic peripheral retinal lesions identified as cobblestone degeneration. Further evaluation and continuous monitoring are recommended to manage and observe progression.

#### Recommendations
- **Monitoring**: Regular follow-up examinations are critical to monitor any progression of degenerative changes.
- **Supportive Treatment**: While there is no definitive treatment for degenerative myopia or cobblestone degeneration, maintaining optimal ocular health and monitoring for complications is essential.
- **Patient Education**: Inform the patient about the chronic nature of the condition and the importance of regular ophthalmic evaluations to manage potential complications.

### Retinal Fundus Image Analysis Report

#### 1. Optic Disc
The optic disc appears to be mildly elevated with a sharp, well-defined margin. There is no evident pallor or cupping. However, there is a light coloration around the optic disc, which may suggest some degree of peripapillary atrophy, common in several retinal and optic neuropathies.

#### 2. Macula
The macula demonstrates signs of exudation and potential hemorrhages. The presence of bright yellowish-white spots within and around the macula suggests hard exudates, which are lipid residues from leaky blood vessels. These changes often indicate diabetic maculopathy or hypertensive retinopathy. Additionally, the macular area does not appear to bear any significant foveal reflex, indicative of macular edema or early stages of macular degeneration.

#### 3. Retinal Blood Vessels
The retinal blood vessels are somewhat tortuous, especially the veins. There is no apparent arteriovenous nicking. The vessel walls have clear demarcation without sign of sheathing or perivascular plaques. However, some of the vessels show minor deviations indicative of local swelling or exudative changes affecting their course.

#### 4. Retinal Background
The retinal background in this image shows multiple changes:
- **Exudates**: Numerous yellow-white spots distributed throughout, prominently around the macula zone.
- **Hemorrhages**: Small, dot-like hemorrhages noted in the periphery and mid-periphery, indicative of microaneurysms or superficial capillary rupture.
- **Pigmentation**: There is an evident alteration in retinal pigmentation, with both hyperpigmentation and hypopigmentation spots that could indicate previous ischemic events or chronic inflammatory responses.

#### 5. Cup-to-Disc Ratio
The cup-to-disc ratio appears to be within normal limits. Estimating from the image, it seems to be around 0.3. This indicates no evident glaucomatous changes based on this metric alone, although a clinical correlation is required.

#### Conclusion
The retinal fundus image demonstrates significant pathological changes, prominently pointing towards chronic hypertensive retinopathy or diabetic retinopathy. This is evidenced by:
- Multiple hard exudates around the macula
- Superficial hemorrhages distributed throughout the retinal background
- Slight tortuosity of retinal vessels

The patient's clinical context concerning systemic diseases like hypertension or diabetes should be evaluated. Further diagnostic testing such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) or Fluorescein Angiography (FA) may be insightful for a comprehensive assessment of macular edema or ischemic areas. Continuous follow-up is crucial to monitor disease progression and therapeutic response.

#### Recommendations:
1. Full ophthalmic examination, including intraocular pressure (IOP) measurement.
2. Blood tests for glucose, HbA1c, and lipid profile.
3. Systemic evaluation by a primary care physician or endocrinologist.
4. Referral to a retina specialist for possible intravitreal anti-VEGF injections if clinically indicated.

ANGIOID STREAKS: Angioid streaks are red or brown irregular lines that radiate from the optic nerve head. They represent breaks in thickened and calcified Bruch's membrane.
ANGIOID STREAKS  IMPORTANTCLINICAL SIGNS: Angioid streaks may appear as light red-orange to dark red-brown. The streaks may form a concentric ring around the optic nerve . They may extend through the macula and into the periphery. They may be thin or four times the width of retinal vessels. They are usually bilateral. Over time the streaks may become more atrophic.
Section III	central exudative chorioretinopathy: During the recovery period, the bleeding and exudation gradually absorbed, and finally the choroidal neovascular membrane was gradually replaced by organizing scars.
RHEGMATOGENOUS RETINAL DETACHMENT  ASSOCIATED CLINICAL SIGNS: Pigment: Granules in the vitreous are almost always seen. Hyperpigmentation or loss of pigment at the RPE is common, especially in chronic RD. Linear pigment ("dema-cation line") suggests chronicity and may be multiple.

The fundus shows yellow-white stripes, which are arc-shaped and concave facing the optic disc. The stripes can be long or short, and the number can be large or small. The author once saw 1 case with as many as 5 to 6 streaks. Hemorrhage is often complicated at the striations, and the striations are covered, or even bleed into the vitreous body. Late repair, especially through rupture and fibrosis of the macula, permanently and severely impaired vision.

### Retinal Fundus Image Report

**Optic Disc:**
- The optic disc appears normal in size and shape. The disc margins are distinct, indicating no signs of papilledema or glaucomatous damage. The color is a healthy pink, suggesting normal perfusion.

**Macula:**
- The macula is centered and slightly darker than the surrounding retina, consistent with normal pigmentation. However, there is a subtle central change that may suggest the early presence of a traumatic macular hole. No evidence of a full-thickness macular hole is visible, and the macula is free from significant edema.

**Retinal Blood Vessels:**
- The retinal blood vessels are normal in appearance, with no tortuosity, narrowing, or dilation observed. There are no signs of hemorrhage or exudates adjacent to the vessels. The arteriovenous ratio appears normal.

**Retinal Background:**
- The retinal background is uniform with no visible lesions, degeneration, or pigmentation abnormalities. There are no signs of retinal hemorrhage or white spots that could indicate underlying degenerative diseases.

**Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
- The cup-to-disc ratio is approximately 0.3, which falls within the normal range. There are no indications of glaucomatous changes.

**Additional Observations:**
- There is no visible preretinal or vitreous hemorrhage, and no signs of retinal or choroidal detachment.

### Impression
- The overall impression is of a healthy retina with a slight central anomaly at the macula that may warrant further investigation for the possibility of early stages of a traumatic macular hole. Monitoring and follow-up assessments using optical coherence tomography (OCT) would be beneficial to evaluate any progression.

Section IX	macular hole: Stage IV: The vitreous body is completely separated from the macula and optic disc, and the Weiss ring appears, and the tear may further increase.
Section IX	macular hole: Stage III: The vitreous body adheres and separates from the fovea, forming a lid membrane, and increasing the hole.
Section 3 Common abnormal signs of fundus  2. Retinal and choroidal hemorrhage: 1. Preretinal hemorrhages occur between the posterior boundary of the vitreous and the inner limiting membrane of the retina or between the inner limiting membrane of the retina and the nerve fiber layer. They originate from blood vessels on the surface of the retina and radial capillaries around the optic disc. Most of them are located at the posterior pole, single or several, in the shape of a half-moon or a boat, of varying sizes. The bleeding was bright red with clear boundaries. Due to gravity, red blood cells are deposited below, so bleeding can form a liquid plane. The color is deepest and denser below, and the higher it goes, the lighter it becomes. If there is too much bleeding, it can enter the vitreous body and form vitreous bleeding. The bleeding begins to be absorbed from the upper part without leaving traces. A thin white curved line is often left on the lower edge. It is commonly caused by trauma, retinal vein obstruction, diabetic retinopathy, blood diseases, and rupture of new blood vessels.
INTRAOCULAR LYMPHOMA  DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: Subretinal infiltrates

### Retinal Fundus Image Report

**Patient Information:**
- ID: Not provided
- Date: Not provided

**Image Quality:**
- The quality of the retinal image appears to be satisfactory for analysis. The optic disc, retinal vessels, and macula are adequately visible.

#### **Findings:**

1. **Optic Disc:**
   - The optic disc is semi-visible and appears slightly blurred but borderline within normal size and color. There is no evident hyperemia or pallor. Margins seem regular despite slight obscurity from surrounding pathology.
  
2. **Macula:**
   - The macular region is not prominently visible in this image, making detailed analysis difficult. However, no obvious macular hole or large exudative lesion is directly evident upon this limited view.

3. **Retinal Blood Vessels:**
   - The blood vessels display a generally uniform caliber with no significant dilation or tortuosity. Arteriovenous ratio seems within normal limits. A noteworthy observation is the vicinity change in the vessel pathways, likely influenced by adjacent pathology.

4. **Retinal Background:**
   - There is a distinct area of chorioretinitis sclopetaria, characterized by concave-shaped areas of hyperpigmentation and visible scarring along the retinal landscape. This feature aligns with the traumatic retinal injury where an abrupt shockwave causes damage, highlighting a differentiated retinal and choroidal involvement.
   - Presence of organized scars within the retina aligning with transition areas with less vascularization, suggesting a chronic phase post-trauma.

5. **Peripheral Retina:**
   - Scattered retinal and choroidal lesions are visible, implying active as well as healing stages of trauma. The peripheral retina shows slight pigmentation disturbances, conforming to a history of trauma.

6. **Cup-to-Disc Ratio:**
   - Due to the obscured nature of the optic disc, the cup-to-disc ratio cannot be assessed accurately from this view. Further vision and internal assessment via ocular coherence tomography (OCT) or slit-lamp examination might be required to determine accurate measurements.

#### **Differential Diagnosis:**
- **Choroidal Rupture:**
  - Although not primarily suggested, it's characterized by its typically posterior location and may exhibit choroidal neovascularization at ruptured peripheries, distinguishing from sclopetaria-induced damages.
- **Choroiditis or Retinal degeneration:**
  - Appearing similar at first glance but typically lack the history and structural damage associated with traumatic etiology.

#### **Conclusion:**
- The retinal image primarily suggests chorioretinitis sclopetaria, consistent with traumatic retinal events leading to characteristic retinal and choroidal damage. Further diagnostic tools alongside patient history are required to consolidate this diagnosis and plan appropriate therapeutic strategies.

#### **Recommendations:**
- **Follow-up Assessment:**
  - Detailed ophthalmic examination including fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) and OCT to provide a comprehensive overview of the retinal and choroidal health.
- **Patient History:**
  - Collect extensive patient history focusing on trauma events or similar incidents that could correlate with the observed retinal changes.
- **Monitoring:**
  - Regular monitoring to observe any progression, particularly looking for signs of choroidal neovascularization which might need intervenous treatment.

- **Observations:** Further detailed imaging or examination is required for a comprehensive assessment of the macula.

**3. Retinal Blood Vessels:**
- **Arteries and Veins:** The retinal blood vessels, including arteries and veins, are well visualized. They appear orderly and show proper branching patterns.
- **Tortuosity:** The vessels do not exhibit significant tortuosity that would indicate an abnormal condition.
- **Caliber:** The caliber of the blood vessels appears normal; no dilation or constriction is noted.
- **Observations:** There is no evidence of occlusion, hemorrhage, or exudation affecting the retinal vessels. The vein dilation present does not indicate disorders like Ocular Ischemic Syndrome.

**4. Retinal Background:**
- **Color and Texture:** The overall retinal background appears generally healthy with uniform coloration. It presents no generalized pigmentary changes, white spots, or other degenerative features.
- **Observations:** There are no features suggestive of retinal degenerative diseases such as Retinitis Pigmentosa, Pigmented Paravenous Retinochoroidal Atrophy, or Crystalline Retinal Degeneration.

**5. Additional Observations:**
- **Peripheral Retina:** The image does not provide a detailed view of the peripheral retina. Further peripheral examination may be necessary to rule out any peripheral vitreoretinal diseases or degenerations.
- **Potential Differential Diagnoses:**
  - **Incontinentia Pigmenti:** The appearance does not suggest early stages of retinal involvement related to this condition.
  - **Acute Ophthalmic Artery Obstruction:** No evidence of delayed retinal arterial or venous filling.
  - **Familial Exudative Vitreoretinopathy:** Characteristics indicative of this condition are not observed in the provided image.

**Clinical Impression:**
The retinal fundus image shows a relatively normal appearance with no obvious signs of significant pathology. The optic disc, retinal vessels, and general retinal background appear unremarkable. However, limitations in visualization of the macular and peripheral regions suggest that additional detailed imaging and examination are warranted for complete assessment.

**Recommendations:**
- **Further Imaging:** Obtain higher resolution images focusing on the macula and peripheral retina.
- **Follow-Up Examination:** Comprehensive retinal examination using techniques such as Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) might be necessary for detailed macular analysis.
- **Clinical Correlation:** Correlate these findings with the patient's clinical history and symptoms for a thorough diagnostic conclusion.

FAMILIAL EXUDATIVE VITREORETINOPATHY  DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS: As for early stages of ROP:
RETINITIS PIGMENTOSA  CLINICAL SIGNS: The classic clinical triad of RP includes:
section I	retinal degenerative disease  6. White spot fundus: [Treatment and Prognosis] No treatment is needed and there is no treatment method.
Section 1 Retinal degenerative diseases  3. Pigmented paravenous retinochoroidal atrophy: [Treatment and Prognosis] There is currently no effective treatment for this disease.
section I	retinal degenerative disease  4. Crystalline retinal degeneration: [Treatment and Prognosis] There is currently no effective treatment for this disease.
OCULAR ISCHEMIC SYNDROME  CLINICAL FEATURES: Dilated, but not tortuous, retinal veins
Section 4 Choroidal leak syndrome and true microophthalmos  1. Clinical characteristics of idiopathic uveal leak syndrome: The blood vessels in the superior sclera were dilated, the inflammatory reaction in the anterior segment of Schlenberg's canal was not obvious, and the intraocular pressure was normal.
ACUTE OPHTHALMIC ARTERY OBSTRUCTION(OCCLUSION)  DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION: Delayed retinal arterial and venous filling.
CHOROIDAL HEMANGIOMA  IMPORTANTCLINICAL SIGNS: Tortuosity of overlying retinal vessels
Section 3 Ultrasonic biomicroscopy  3. UBM images of vitreous diseases: (1) vitreous opacity
Section III	central exudative chorioretinopathy: During the recovery period, the bleeding and exudation gradually absorbed, and finally the choroidal neovascular membrane was gradually replaced by organizing scars.
Section 4 Abnormal fluorescence pattern in fundus  1. Strong fluorescence: (3) Abnormal vessels
DRY OR NONEXUDATIVE AGE-RELATED MACULAR DEGENERATION  TABLE 1-1. Risk of Choroidal Neovascularization (CNV) for Eyes with Drusen (Fellow Eye with Exudative CNV): Multiple large drusen
CHOROIDAL MELANOCYTOMA  IMPORTANT CLINICAL SIGNS: It is usually unilateral.
Section 3 Optic nerve and blood vessels  5. Blood supply in the posterior area of the sieve plate: The posterior cribriform plate region receives blood supplies from various sources, such as branches from the Zinn arterial ring and branches from the pial vessels forming a vascular network
PERSISTENT HYPERPLASTIC PRIMARY VITREOUS/PERSISTENT FETAL VASCULATURE  EPIDEMIOLOGY AND ETIOLOGY: Anterior and posterior forms exist, and both may be present together.
Section IX	macular hole: Stage II: Continuous tangential traction causes photoreceptors and radial nerve fibers to move eccentrically, and the central part of the fovea splits to form a stage II hole. At this time, local PVD occurs.
