{"title":"Eye fundus image of normal person  1. Eye fundus image of normal person","text":"The fundus of a normal person consists of the optic disc (or optic disc), macula, and retinal blood vessels. The optic nipple is located at the center of the fundus slightly to the nasal side. It is circular or vertical oval, light red, and has a diameter of about 1.5mm. Its center has a funnel-shaped depression called physiological cup or physiological depression. The ratio of physiological cup to optic disc in normal people is 0.3-0.5. The macula is located about 4mm on the temporal side of the optic disc, showing a bright dark red color, with a central light reflection slightly recessed in the center. The retinal blood vessel consists of the central retinal artery and the central vein. The retinal artery is orange-red and enters the eye from the center of the optic disc. It then branches to form supratemporal, infratemporal, nasal and infranasal branches. Finally, after multi-forked branches, it forms capillaries reaching the periphery. In normal people, there will be some variations in the shape of arterial branches. The retinal veins are dark red and generally accompany the arteries. The ratio of arterial and venous diameters is approximately."}

Fundus fluorescence angiography (FFA) in normal subjects","text":"Retinal fluorescence: After 0.5 to 1 second after the choroidal fluorescence fills, the central retinal artery begins to fill, and usually distributes rapidly to the entire arterial system within 1 to 2 seconds. In the late stage of the arterial phase, capillaries begin to fill, initially in a speck-like shape, and quickly appear in a reticular shape. Fluorescent enters the venules, and then quickly enters the major veins. This is called the arteriovenous phase. During this period, high-speed photography can be used to show laminar flow of the arteries or veins.

Because the choroid is a lobular structure and the distribution of blood vessels is divided into sections, the filling time of the blood vessels is very different. The filling time of the choroidal artery is about 1 second earlier than that of the retinal artery. In the arterial phase, the choroidal artery at the posterior pole is tortuous. The arteriovenous phase is characterized by the combined fluorescence effect of multiple intersecting arterioles and venules to produce diffuse high fluorescence (about 10-30 seconds). This is followed by filling of capillaries, weakening of choroidal artery fluorescence during the venous phase, enhancing of venous fluorescence, filling of vortex veins (about 15 to 35 seconds), and blurring of choroidal fluorescence in the late stage."}

{"title":"Chapter 1 Fluorescence fundus angiography  1. Overview","text":"Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA) is one of the important methods for the diagnosis of retinal diseases. The basic principle is to inject sodium fluorescein (a fluorescent dye) into the subject's body via veins. When the dye reaches the retinal circulation, it produces fluorescence under the excitation of blue-green light, and then through a specially equipped fundus camera, the dye is used to film the entire process of fundus circulation. Because fluorescein sodium cannot enter the retina through the normal retinal vascular endothelium (blood-retinal barrier), it can clearly display the morphology of fundus blood vessels during fundus circulation. FFA can be used to observe subtle changes in fundus blood vessels. The permeability of choroidal capillaries is greater than that of the retina. Sodium fluorescein can exude freely through the choroidal capillaries. Because sodium fluorescein in the choroid cannot enter the retina through the normal retinal pigment epithelium layer (blood-retinal pigment epithelium barrier), coupled with the blocking of pigments in the retinal pigment epithelium layer, the condition of the retinal pigment epithelium layer can be highlighted. Diseases of retinal blood vessels or pigment epithelium can cause the destruction of the above-mentioned blood-eye barrier and lead to the leakage of fluorescein sodium, which can provide a basis for the diagnosis of retinal diseases, and can also guide treatment. It is also valuable for the study of pathogenesis. FFA has been used in clinical practice since the 1960s and has gradually become popular. The development of FFA technology is of epoch-making significance to the development of ophthalmopathy. At present, it has become one of the indispensable examination items for the diagnosis, research and guidance of ocular fundus diseases. Our country introduced this technology in the early 1970s."}

{"title":"Chapter 1 Fluorescence fundus angiography  2. Basic principles","text":"In vivo process: After fluorescein sodium is injected into the blood vessel, it combines with plasma proteins (mainly plasma albumin), and 20% is free in the blood. Only free sodium fluorescein can fluoresce when excited by blue light. Within 1 minute after intravenous injection, fluorescein sodium was spread throughout the body. Due to the physiological barrier between the normal retina and the central nervous system, fluorescein sodium cannot leak, and other tissue blood vessels can leak fluorescein sodium to cause tissue staining. For example, skin and mucosa turn yellow after injection. Sodium fluorescein is completely excreted through the liver and kidneys within 24 hours. A small amount is excreted through the biliary tract."}
{"title":"Chapter 1 Fluorescence fundus angiography  2. Basic principles","text":"Barrier: There are two types of barriers in the fundus tissue, namely the blood-retinal barrier (inner barrier) and the blood-pigment epithelium barrier (outer barrier).

Normal fundus manifestations","text":"Sodium fluorescein is injected into the blood vessel through the antecubital vein, and the time it takes for it to flow through the right heart, pulmonary circulation, left heart, aorta, carotid artery and ophthalmic artery to reach the fundus is called arm-retina circulation time (ART). The circulation time of the arm-retina is affected by many factors, such as the age of the subject, the thickness of the blood vessels, the speed of the heart and blood flow, the concentration of sodium fluorescein, injection speed and imaging technology, so there are large individual differences. Normal human arm-retinal circulation time is 10 to 15 seconds. According to the different stages of sodium fluorescein flowing through the central retinal vascular system, the process of FFA is divided into the following four stages:"}

During the imaging process, its fluorescence form and intensity constantly change. Inflammation, trauma, vascular lesions, degeneration and tumors can be seen in the fundus. Another situation is when the dye enters the interstitial space between the tissue layers, causing fluorescein to accumulate. When the retinal pigment epithelium detaches, fluorescein accumulates in the subcutaneous layer of the pigment and generally appears as round or nearly round high fluorescence with clear boundaries. During the imaging process, its fluorescence shape and size remain unchanged. When retinal neuroepithelium detaches, fluorescein can accumulate in the subepithelial nerve, presenting as local high fluorescence in the late stage.

It was initially used to measure the output of the heart and was soon used to examine other body systems. Since Kogure et al. performed ICGA absorption imaging in monkey eyes in 1970, the application of ICGA in ophthalmology has gone through three stages: indocyanine green (ICG) absorption imaging, ICG fluorescence imaging and digital ICG imaging. Due to the limitations of imaging technology, the image quality of ICGA in the early years was poor, and its clinical application research developed slowly. In 1992, Guyer et al. used a high-resolution digital camera system for ICGA, which improved the clarity of ICGA images. Clinical research confirmed that ICGA is better than since then in displaying choroidal neovascular disease, and its clinical application gradually became popular."}

Serious adverse reactions mostly occur in patients with advanced kidney disease and undergoing renal dialysis. Therefore, ICG dye should be used with caution in patients with renal failure and undergoing renal dialysis. In addition, patients with chronic liver disease should also be cautious because ICG is excreted through the liver.

Basic principles","text":"The light beam emitted by the low-coherence superdiode illuminator as the light source is evenly divided into two beams by a fiber coupler, one beam being sent into the reference optical path of the interferometer, and the other beam being sent into the detection optical path. The reflected or backscattered light in the two optical paths is reintegrated into one beam at the optical fiber coupler and detected by the optical diode, and the image is obtained by displaying the pseudo-color gray scale values corresponding to different backscattered intensity pairs generated by tissues at different depths. Bright colors such as white and red represent areas of strong light reflection, while dark tones such as blue and black correspond to areas of weak light reflection. Very similar to the imaging principle of B-ultrasound, the OCT system obtains two-dimensional (tomographic) pseudo-color images of the inspected area of the sample through multiple longitudinal scans similar to A-ultrasound (usually 100 times). Through multiple scans at regular intervals, the biological structure of the sample can be three-dimensional reconstructed, and then tomographic images of any position and direction of the sample can be obtained."}
{"title":"Chapter 3 Coherent optical tomography  1. Basic principles","text":"Interference occurs only when the optical path difference in the two optical paths matches the coherence wavelength of the light source. Therefore, the coherence wavelength of the light source determines the axial resolution of the system, that is, the axial resolution is inversely proportional to the spectral band width of the light source (Currently, OCT systems have most of the light source spectral bands, which can be confirmed by measuring the propagation function of a point at the position of the plane mirror in the actual optical path. The lateral resolution not only depends on the size of the spot generated after the probe light is focused on the sample, but the lateral pixel density also plays an important role in determining the lateral resolution. The convergence characteristics of light make it difficult to achieve high lateral resolution and high depth detection range of the system. It is usually necessary to obtain the largest possible confocal parameter (detection depth) while ensuring effective lateral resolution."}

Age-related macular degeneration","text":"It is well known that laser photocoagulation can effectively reduce or delay vision loss caused by choroidal neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration (AMD). Photocoagulation requires the use of new imaging techniques to better observe those hidden neovascular membranes. Hee et al. used OCT to conduct histomorphological studies of 391 patients with exudative and non-exudative AMD, opening up a new area of work in this area. Based on a summary of OCT images of all AMD patients examined, they classified the changes in exudative AMD into the following five categories."}

At the same time, the presence of interstitial or subretinal fluid or rupture of the RPE and choroidal vascular layers must be observed to distinguish it from enhanced reflexes due to pigment atrophy."}

{"title":"2. Clinical application  1. Age-related macular degeneration","text":"OCT allows for a detailed quantitative assessment of the morphological changes in many exudative AMD found under ophthalmoscopy. Even small amounts of subretinal fluid can appear on OCT as an unreflective area between the RPE and the neuroretina. On the other hand, retinal edema is manifested by an increase in retinal thickness and a decrease in diffuse retinal light reflection, which is probably the result of the decrease in the density of optical backscatter sites in the retina caused by edema. Serous RPE detachment can be distinguished from serous retinal neuroepithelial detachment by distinguishing the height of the reflective layer. When RPE detachment occurs, the reflections from the choroid vascular layer and the deep choroid will be blocked. The correlation analysis between OCT and FFA in 90 eyes of 86 patients with exudative AMD who had not been treated with laser showed that CNV that usually appeared as typical on FFA showed as easily defined on OCT, while the occult CNV in FFA corresponded to the CNV that was not easily defined on OCT. However, there are some important exceptions: typical CNV sometimes appears as fibrovascular pigment epithelium detachment on OCT, which may be the reason why OCT has a higher sensitivity in distinguishing between neovascular membranes located under the retina and those located under the RPE. Therefore, an easy-to-define CNV on OCT may indicate that new blood vessels have penetrated through a hole in the glass membrane; while a complete reflective band formed by the RPE of patients with fibrovascular pigment epithelium detachment on OCT may indicate that new blood vessels are still confined below the RPE. Although further research is needed, current results show that OCT can provide a lot of biological structure information with practical application value, such as providing a basis for surgical removal of CNV. Although only a small number of AMD patients have CNV suitable for surgical treatment, these advances are of great significance in the treatment of other diseases such as histoplasmosis. There are also some hidden CNVs that appear as easily defined CNVs on OCT, which is the result of bleeding concealing the fluorescent image of the new vascular membrane. The near-infrared light source used in OCT can effectively eliminate the interference of bleeding. Changes such as non-exudative AMD, soft drusen, focal atrophy, and pigmentation also have characteristic manifestations on OCT images."}
{"title":"2. Clinical application  1. Age-related macular degeneration","text":"At the same time, when conducting clinical observations of AMD, OCT also has its own limitations: since OCT provides tomographic images, a single OCT image can only provide very thin tissue section data about the boundaries of CNV, and attempts to collect multiple images to determine the boundaries of the entire CNV are still difficult to practice; due to the occlusion of detached pigment epithelium, OCT is difficult to effectively image CNV under PED; Although OCT has good penetration for imaging compared with FFA, thick subretinal or interlaminar imaging can quickly attenuate the probe light, making it difficult to effectively image the deep choroid; in addition, reflections from special tissues within the retina will also be affected by the absorption and scattering characteristics of the dielectric layer."}
{"title":"2. Clinical application  2. Macular hole","text":"Accurate staging of macular holes is of great significance in the choice of surgical methods and postoperative evaluation. OCT provides us with a new option in this regard: in the early stage of the first stage, the macular hole appears on OCT as a thinning or disappearance of the fovea, accompanied by a hyporeflective area under or within the fovea; in the second stage, it appears as a partial rupture of the superficial retina accompanied by the loss of fine full-thickness retinal tissue; The tertiary tear has been completely formed on OCT, and sometimes the lid membrane (lid lid), which is almost completely separated from the edge of the tear, can be seen. The degree of separation between the vitreous and the fovea can be estimated by the distance between the lid membrane and the retinal surface. In some cases, it can also be obtained by directly observing the posterior limiting membrane of the vitreous body;OCT can also show different forms of retinal detachment and subretinal effusion around the tear; On OCT images of stage four macular holes, the posterior vitreous body was completely separated from the optic disc and the posterior and peripheral retina. For those resting macular holes, OCT tomographic images can be identified by discovering a false epithecum hanging from the normal-appearing fovea. Precise quantitative information obtained from OCT includes the diameter of the tear and the extent of subretinal fluid around the tear. The complete loss of direct retinal tissue is not the only reason that affects vision. The detachment and thickening of retinal tissue around the tear are also of great significance. OCT can provide accurate information at the micron level on these parameters, so it plays an important role in monitoring the development of the tear and postoperative recovery."}
{"title":"clinical application  3. Epiretinal membrane","text":"Wilkins et al. performed OCT on 180 eyes of 160 patients diagnosed with epiretinal membrane by slit lamp microscopy, fundus imaging, and FFA examination. Among them, 49 eyes (26%) could be clearly seen on OCT images due to the partial separation of the anterior membrane from the retinal internal limiting membrane, and were independently diagnosed based on OCT images; 125 eyes (67%) of the remaining 137 eyes could be distinguished on OCT images due to the following characteristics: \u2460 The outline of the fovea became steeper or narrower, indicating the presence of a pseudo-macular hole, in 32 eyes;\u2461 There was a significant difference in reflectance between the anterior membrane and the retina, in 65 eyes; \u2462 The boundary of anterior membrane hyperplasia or close to the retinal surface, 92 eyes. However, the anterior membrane of the remaining 7 eyes was tightly adhered to the retina and could not be displayed on OCT images because there were no changes in the above morphology or reflective characteristics. Compared with slit lamp and FFA, OCT examination is easy to eliminate the influence of subjective factors and has higher sensitivity. Even if FFA does not leak, it can detect early changes such as thickening of the macula and retina, and can accurately measure the thickness of the anterior retinal membrane and the relationship between the anterior membrane and the retina. With the further deepening of research in this area, these parameters will surely prove to be of great significance in evaluating the prognosis of epiretinal membrane surgery."}
{"title":"clinical application  4. Central serous chorioretinopathy","text":"Clinical follow-up study by Hee et al. showed that: Central serous chorioretinopathy, hereinafter referred to as serous disease (central serouschorioretinopathy (CSC), the thickening of the detached neuroretinal layer during the disease, the changes in the height of subretinal fluid and RPE, and the gradual thinning of the thickened retina as the disease recovers, the height of subretinal fluid decreases or even disappears, and the recovery of RPE function can be accurately measured on OCT images. During the development of the lesion, the color change of the corresponding tissue site in the image caused by changes in the reflection intensity of the retinal neuroepithelium and RPE to probe light was confirmed, and the results were consistent with the results of slit lamp microscopy, FFA and best-corrected visual acuity. OCT's unique high-resolution characteristics allow it to detect small retinal neuroepithelial detachments and trace subretinal fluid that cannot be detected by slit lamps or FFA. In addition, due to the large age range of onset of CSC (20 to 50 years old), the diagnosis is often confused with AMD in elderly patients. This situation is more likely to occur when hidden neovascular membranes exist. Due to the obvious differences in light reflection characteristics between neovascular tissue and serous subretinal fluid, OCT has a higher sensitivity than traditional examination methods in distinguishing neuroretinal detachment from pigment epithelium and choroidal vessel abnormalities caused by neovascular membranes."}

This is of great significance in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, retinal vessel obstruction, and uveitis that are often accompanied by macular edema."}
{"title":"clinical application  6. Study on the anatomical relationship between congenital optic disc fovea and maculopathy","text":"Congenital optic disc fovea has been described more than a hundred years ago. Although there have been various theories about the source of subretinal fluid in people with retinal detachment, its exact pathogenesis is not very clear. Krivoy and Rutledge independently used OCT to conduct anatomical studies on the optic disc, optic disc temporal retina, and macula retina of patients with congenital optic disc fovea. They found that there was a direct channel between the subretinal space and the vitreous cavity in no eye. In all eyes with serous retinal detachment, cystoid degeneration and cleavage of the macula area and the retina around the optic disc were present, and there were intertissue bridges in the cleavage space. The results unanimously support the theory put forward by Lincoff et al. in 1988 that fluid enters the subcutaneous skin directly from the fovea. They also described the development of the disease as follows: cystic degeneration and cleavage cavities first appeared in the retina adjacent to the optic disc adjacent to the fovea, and gradually spread to the surrounding retina. There is a channel between the cleavage chamber and the subretinal space, and the synaptic transport maintained by the nerve fibers or inter-tissue bridges in the cleavage chamber allows the cleavage retina to retain certain functions. This is why the cleavage or cystic retina does not necessarily appear. Eventually, retinoschisis will involve the macula, which will lead to detachment of the retinal pigment epithelium. The explanation for those eyes that have had macula detachment and have now been restored is that cell debris or free pigment epithelium blocks the channel between the fovea and the cleavage chamber, causing the final collapse and replacement of the cleavage chamber and the outer retina."}

In the late stage, proliferative lesions can also be seen, such as anterior membrane hyperplasia, vitreous traction, etc. The sectional images provided by OCT allow us to better understand the manifestations and nature of maculopathy. OCT images showed diffuse thickening and edema of the light band of the neuroepithelial layer, cystoid macular edema and fluid accumulation, neuroepithelial detachment and cleavage, fatty exudation and hemorrhage.

Its significance lies in the following aspects: \u2460 Obtaining quantitative data on the structural abnormalities of the anterior segment, such as keratoconus, interstitial keratitis, corneal edema, iris and corneal masses, and the degree of cataract and lens opacity; \u2461 As a brand-new non-contact biometric technology, OCT not only provides a new way to accurately calculate the power of contact lenses and artificial bodies, but more importantly, due to the non-damage determined by non-contact, OCT can accurately track and observe the correction power of refractive surgery in real time and observe the effect of filtration surgery in early post-operation.

Schuman et al. conducted a series of studies in this regard. The results of multi-factor analysis showed that OCT has advantages such as high sensitivity, high resolution, and strong repeatability in early diagnosis of glaucoma and early detection of lesion progression that are difficult to achieve by other technical means. It can even detect changes in the thickness of the optic nerve fiber layer before changes in the visual field. Another interesting finding is that there is a clear correlation between the thinning of the nerve fiber layer and age, but this relationship does not exist between the cup-to-disc ratio and the neuroretinal marginal area and age."}
{"title":"clinical application  12. Evaluation of retinal photocoagulation response","text":"Experimental studies conducted by Toth using rhesus monkeys have shown that OCT can provide information on early morphological changes in tissue responses in the photocoagulation area starting from the moment of photocoagulation. The images obtained by his research clearly show that the earliest reaction in the retina in the entire photocoagulation area occurs within seconds after photocoagulation, while the reaction in the inner layer of the retina occurs within seconds or minutes thereafter. In the first few minutes after photocoagulation, relatively low-reflection tiny vacuoles appear on the edge of the highly reflective photocoagulation zone, and expand in the following 1 - 2 days. An 8-day series of follow-up observations clearly revealed the relationship between enhanced reflexes in the photocoagulation area and pigment migration in the retina. Comparative studies demonstrated that the OCT image analysis results were consistent with those obtained with traditional histopathological slices. As a non-invasive optical histological examination method, the use of OCT can effectively reduce the need for animals for experimental research. Another important significance of this study is that the idea it provides for comparative study of histopathological slices and OCT images in photocoagulation areas has deepened our understanding of the role of OCT in the diagnosis and treatment of retinal diseases."}

In 1982, Mainster et al. first used it in ophthalmology clinical practice for fundus examination and fluorescent angiography. In the late 1980s, Scheider et al. first used ICGA. In the 1990s, Germany's Rodenstock Company and Zeiss Company both developed new types of SLO, which were equipped with laser emission tubes of several wavelengths in the same equipment. Therefore, both FFA and ICGA can be performed, and visual function can be checked in conjunction with auxiliary equipment. In 1992, Elsner et al. introduced the application of SLO with adjustable laser emission wavelength in age-related macular degeneration. In 1995, Bischoff et al. introduced new improvements to SLO, allowing simultaneous FFA and ICGA."}

Basic information of equipment","text":"SLO is a method for fundus examination that uses a weak laser beam as an illumination or excitation light source. In terms of optical path design, a galvanometer with two mirrors is used to scan the fundus of the laser beam at 50\/60Hz in the horizontal direction and 15625Hz in the vertical direction. The combined result of vertical and horizontal scans forms a scanning raster. The scanning grating is focused on the retina through a series of combination lenses to form a focused scanning light spot. The reflected light from the fundus is condensed on the photoelectric amplifier through the combination of the pupil and lens, and then photoelectrically converted to form an image signal."}

The intensity of the illumination light used for general fundus examination is lower than that of argon laser and lower than that of infrared laser."}
{"title":"Section 2 Laser scanning ophthalmoscope and its application in fundus examination  1.

Moreover, since the incident light passes through the combined lens, the diameter of the light in the pupil area is less than 1mm, it provides the possibility of inspecting the fundus with a small pupil."}

When examined at an angle of 20\u00b0, you can almost see the structure of the macular arch ring.

{"title":"Section 2 Laser scanning ophthalmoscope and its application in fundus examination  2.

SLO provides a laser beam with a near-infrared wavelength of 780mm and a corresponding filter combination, combined with the use of indocyanine green (whose absorption and emission wavelengths are in the near-infrared spectral range) dye to perform ICGA, which is a major function of SLO. Since Scheider et al. applied SLO in clinical practice in 1989, it has been widely used in clinical practice. It provides a powerful means for clinical research on choroidal circulation, allowing doctors to observe choroidal circulation under dynamic physiological and pathological conditions in vivo. A prominent advantage of using SLO for ICGA is that it is extremely convenient to convert FFA and ICGA modes to each other or synchronize imaging during examination, which is conducive to the comparison of the two, thus helping to diagnose the disease and understand the degree and nature of the lesion."}

In addition, since the laser scanning ophthalmoscope has a corresponding computer image processing supporting system, after the imaging images are superimposed by a computer, the distance that a single white blood cell moves in a certain blood vessel per unit time can be displayed, so that the blood flow of white blood cells can be calculated. speed."}
{"title":"Section 2 Laser scanning ophthalmoscope and its application in fundus examination  3. Laser scanning ophthalmoscope measures retinal blood circulation","text":"Since the images obtained by SLO are real-time recordings, more than 30 images can be captured per second, coupled with good focus and high resolution, the blood flow speed in a certain blood vessel can be calculated directly based on the distance that blood flow travels in a certain blood vessel over a period of time. In order to reduce errors, select several blood vessels (such as 15 blood vessels) at a time, and select multiple points for each blood vessel for measurement and calculation to obtain the average blood flow velocity of the retina. Moreover, due to the high temporal resolution of SLO and the matching high-definition imaging system, it is possible to use SLO to observe visible components in retinal microvessels. Tanaka et al. used SLO to perform fluorescent angiography. Among the 130 eyes he studied, 63 eyes could see the capillary network next to the fovea of the macula and the movement of formed elements in the blood vessels could be seen, with the movement of about 1.2 um per second. He used SLO to observe retinal circulation in fundus diseases such as diabetic retinopathy, branch retinal vein obstruction, and age-related macular degeneration. Clear high-fluorescent spots can be seen following the blood flow from arterioles to capillaries and then to venules. These dots have a diameter equal to or slightly larger than the capillaries, and their speed is faster in front of the capillaries, slower in the capillaries, and faster behind the capillaries. The distance between two high fluorescent spots changes greatly, generally around 100um. There are two types of capillaries around the fovea: one is where high-fluorescent spots appear more frequently, and the other is where high-fluorescent spots appear less frequently. During the arterial and capillary phase of fluorescence angiography, such high-fluorescent spots are more clearly visible, allowing the direction of blood flow to be clearly seen. He believed that the highly fluorescent formed components in the blood vessels he saw were white blood cells and\/or platelets. In vitro experiments, he found that red blood cells in the blood did not stain fluorescence, while white blood cells and platelets stained fluorescence, which confirmed this. Wolf et al. used SLO to measure the blood flow velocities of the capillary network around the macula in 21 normal subjects and 13 diabetic patients at mm\/s, respectively. Arend et al. used SLO to measure the blood flow velocity of the para-macula capillary network in 32 normal subjects, and compared it with blue field measurement technique. The blood flow velocities measured by the two methods were (2.68\u00b10.3)mm\/s and (0.89\u00b10.2)mm\/s, respectively. The difference between the two is large, which may be due to the fact that SLO measures the blood flow velocity of individual red blood cells in the para-macula capillaries, while the latter measures the average blood flow velocity of the blood flow in the para-macula capillaries. Harris et al. also used SLO to measure the blood flow velocity of great retinal vessels and paramacular capillaries under different PCO_2, and found that the blood flow velocity of retinal vessels was affected by PCO_2."}

Even if the recording is performed, the movement of such high-fluorescent spots cannot be seen due to its poor definition and contrast."}
{"title":"Section 2 Laser scanning ophthalmoscope and its application in fundus examination  4. General fundus examination","text":"Because monochromatic light of different wavelengths has different penetration, absorption and reflection characteristics in the retina and choroid layer, and the difference between monochromatic light and white light is that it only penetrates into a certain level of the fundus, the contrast is increased and the chromatic aberration is eliminated., greatly increasing the visibility of the fine structures in the fundus. The light source of SLO is a laser beam, which is an ideal monochromatic light. Therefore, it has its unique advantages when used for ordinary fundus examination."}

{"title":"Section 2 Laser scanning ophthalmoscope and its application in fundus examination  4.

Delori et al. found that light from 475 to 520nm is very suitable for inspecting superficial structures of the fundus. SLO provides blue-green laser sources at 488nm and 514nm. When the optic nerve fiber layer is examined, the course of the optic nerve fiber bundle and the presence or absence of defects can be clearly seen. Miglior et al. used SLO to examine the optic nerve fiber layer and found that it was sensitive and reproducible, and believed that it could be used for clinical examination of the optic nerve fiber layer. It is also ideal for examining superficial lesions and raised lesions of the fundus. For example, when used for the examination of central serous chorioretinopathy, small serous retinal detachment can be found. Because of its fine light and large depth of field, the three-dimensional effect is extremely strong. SLO can also be used to examine the shape of optic papilla, cup and disc, cribriform plate, etc., opening up a new way for the study of glaucoma and ischemic optic papilla disease."}

{"title":"Section 2 Laser scanning ophthalmoscope and its application in fundus examination  4. General fundus examination","text":"As the wavelength of light increases, its penetration also increases. When the wavelength is greater than 589mm, because it exceeds the light absorption wavelength of hemoglobin (540 - 570nm), light reflection from the fundus is dominant. Moreover, due to the strong penetration of long-wave light, what the examination mainly shows is the structural and morphological information of the deeper layers of the fundus, such as the choroid. Rodenstock's Model 101 SLO provides a laser with a wavelength of 633nm and an infrared laser beam of 780 mm. When inspecting the fundus, the structures and lesions underneath can be seen through the superficial materials of the fundus and the obstruction of the pigment epithelium. Hartnett et al. used infrared light to examine patients with age-related macular degeneration and compared it with FFA and ICGA. They found that infrared light showed drusen and subretinal deposits better than FFA and ICGA, and examined subretinal neovascular membranes. It can also provide useful information. Therefore, this method is considered to be a non-invasive, sensitive and practical inspection method. When red light or infrared light is used for examination, especially the latter is invisible light and has strong penetration. It is extremely convenient for examination of patients with refractive matrix opacity, children and severe photophobia. Moreover, due to the strong penetration and large depth of field of the light beam, posterior lens capsule and vitreous opacity, and posterior vitreous detachment can be displayed together when examining the fundus. Beckman et al. used Rodenstock101 SLO to conduct fundus examination on patients with different degrees of cataract, and found that it was significantly superior to general fundus photography. However, due to the heterogeneity of lens opacity, confocal mode should be selected for examination, and the wavelength of the inspection light should be better and individualized. Kirkpatrick et al. used multi-wavelength SLO to conduct fundus examination of cataract patients. The results showed that the fundus image obtained was better than that obtained with indirect ophthalmoscope, and the image quality for displaying fundus blood vessels was also higher than that obtained with fundus photography. The image effect obtained was the best when examined with a 590-mm wavelength laser. The authors also believe that using confocal techniques can increase contrast of blood vessels."}

The method is to add an additional acousto-optic modulator to the SLO, which can make extremely subtle changes to the intensity of the laser. The computer-controlled modulator can produce images like those on a television screen. These images can be arbitrary symbols or images and can be projected onto the retina, just as a movie image is projected onto the screen. There are two ways to measure dark spots. One is to use dark stimuli on a bright background; the other is to use light stimuli on a dark background. The stimulated image can be clearly seen on the TV where it is projected on the retina. In this way, the position of the scotoma in the fovea can be accurately determined, with an accuracy of up to 100um. The position of macular lesions and sub-macular neovascular membranes can be accurately located, thereby avoiding unnecessary damage during laser treatment of the macular area. Combined examination of SLO scotoma and planar visual field can provide more clinically useful information."}

Confocal laser scanning ophthalmoscope","text":"Confocal scanning laser ophthalmology (CSLO) is a variable confocal device placed in the optical path of the SLO. The intensity of backlit scattered light is recorded by a computer as a digital image signal through photoelectric conversion. By changing the position of the confocal focus, digital images of the fundus of different planes can be obtained. Each image consists of 256\u00d7256 pixels. The computer constructs the obtained series of images of different layers of the fundus into a topological image of the fundus, which is the fundus topography. The position of the maximum light reflection of each pixel represents the bulge of a certain point in the fundus reflected by the pixel. The height measurement of each pixel is the absolute number from the focus plane of the eye (a constant) to a certain point where the retina bulges. A three-dimensional topography of its bulges or depressions is obtained, which can intuitively understand the degree of macular degeneration, especially macular edema. Three-dimensional data analysis of the optic nerve papilla can also be performed to calculate the optic disc depth, C\/D ratio, disc rim area, etc. Such inspections can be carried out by CSLO provided by Zeiss and Heidelberg Optical Systems Engineering in Germany and LDT in the United States. The Heidelberg Retinal Angiography System II is currently the most advanced laser scanning fundus imaging system. Its characteristics are: the resolution has been further improved to 1536\u00d71536 pixels. Due to the use of a confocal device, a series of scanning images can be obtained by moving the focus plane, and the maximum scanning depth can reach 8 mm. Since HRA provides image capture at 16 frames per second, early dynamic images of FFA or ICGA can be obtained and stored in a computer for easy direct viewing. The computer software provided by HRA can perform large and wide-angle seamless puzzles of 120\u00b0 images, simultaneous photography of FFA and ICGA, simultaneous photography of FFA and infrared light, simultaneous photography of ICGA and infrared light, and superposition processing to understand and compare the performance and interrelationships of different inspection methods."}

Ultrasound is an indispensable means. However, due to their relatively low resolution, the currently commonly used A-type and B-type ultrasound diagnostic instruments cannot well display the vitreous and retinal periphery. Therefore, they cannot examine anterior segment proliferative vitreoretinopathy (APVR), which has certain limitations.

The patient lies on his back, and after topical anesthesia, the eye cup is placed in the patient's upper and lower forniums. Fill the eye cup with normal saline, place the UBM probe into the water bath cup, and start the inspection. After routine examination of the anterior chamber axial depth and peripheral chamber angle status, starting from 12 o'clock, radial scanning was performed as much as possible from front to back, and the sagittal section in this radial direction was obtained. All sections were taken every 1.5 hours, and a total of 8 directions were taken around the eye. Because one scan only obtains a front-to-back distance of 5mm, the pictures from multiple scans can be spliced together to obtain a more comprehensive sagittal view of the anterior segment. When examining the peripheral vitreous and retina, the patient's eye must be turned to the opposite side to facilitate examination. Because the upper and lower parts of the eyeball are blocked by eyelids and are not easily exposed, it is difficult to examine the upper and lower peripheral retina in patients with slightly smaller palpebral fissure.

Extraocular MRI examination needs to be combined with fat suppression technology.\u2460 Direct signs: The choroidal mass is mushroom-shaped or round-shaped, protruding towards the vitreous body, with smooth edges; ultrasound shows dark areas, showing \"hollowed out\" phenomenon, and the choroid is depressed at the base, which is more characteristic. CT showed a high density mass. Because melanin in tumors is a paramagnetic substance, MRI can shorten, and show short and short signal. The degree of shortening is related to the melanin contents, but it is not proportional. In addition, MRI shows that short and short signals are related to magnetic field strength, and high-field strong ones are easier to display. When the tumor is large, necrosis and cystic change may occur, resulting in uneven density or signal. After enhancement, the lesion was significantly enhanced. It should be particularly noteworthy here that dynamic scanning must be performed for MRI enhancement to determine the degree of enhancement (melanoma is high-signal).\u2461 Secondary signs: The tumor invades extrabulbar. An irregular mass forms around the eyeball with density or signal characteristics similar to that of the eyeball. Secondary retinal detachment manifested as long and trombone shadows around the tumor, without detachment at the optic disc, and traction signs formed at the optic disc, without enhancement after enhancement."}

{"title":"Chapter 8: Diabetic Retinopathy","text":"Diabetes can cause multiple systemic complications. Because diabetic retinopathy is one of the serious eye diseases that cause blindness, it has attracted much attention. In 1985, my country's ophthalmology group formulated a classification and staging standard for diabetic retinopathy. This standard is concise, clear, easy to master, and has been widely used in clinical practice. The brief description is as follows: it is divided into background type and proliferative type. The former includes periods, and the latter includes periods 4 - 5. Stage 1: Hemorrhage and microaneurysms. Stage 2: Stage 1 plus hard exudation. Phase 3: Add silk and cotton spots in Phase 2. Stage 4: New blood vessels appear. Stage 5: Fibrotic membrane hyperplasia. Stage 6: Traction retinal detachment. With the development of medicine and the deepening of understanding of diabetic retinopathy, the shortcomings of this classification have gradually emerged. There is insufficient understanding of the importance of certain lesions, such as intraretinal microvascular abnormalities (IRMA), venous beading, silk cotton spots, etc., and there is a lack of classification of maculopathy. In 2002, at the Sydney International Conference, a new classification was proposed based on the old classification of diabetic retinopathy in order to unify understanding. The new classification is divided into non-proliferative (to replace the previous background type) and proliferative types. Non-proliferative type is divided into: mild: only microaneurysms; moderate: between mild and severe; severe: with any of the following three: \u2460 There are more than 20 retinal bleeding points in the four quadrants of the fundus;\u2461 There must be venous beading in at least 2 quadrants;\u2462 There must be obvious IRMA in at least 1 quadrant and no new blood vessels.

The optic disc is edema or atrophied, or the hyperplasia membrane pulls the optic nerve. In the advanced stage of proliferative lesions, optic nerve atrophy is common.\u2462 Preretinal hemorrhage blocks macula or vitreous hemorrhage.

They develop extremely rapidly, mature quickly and require surgical treatment. It is relatively rare clinically. Elderly cataracts are more common in patients with diabetic retinopathy. Development is faster than normal. There is also a complicated cataract, which is complicated by advanced proliferative retinopathy, and the surgical effect is far worse than that of senile cataracts.\u2463 Neovascular glaucoma.

With the aging of society in my country, the number of patients with this disease is also increasing. In 1986, the Fundus Disease Group of the Chinese Medical Association discussed and formulated the name and diagnostic classification standards of ARMD at the Second National Academic Conference on Fundus Diseases. There are two types based on clinical and pathological manifestations, namely atrophic type (also known as \"dry\") and exudative type (also known as \"wet\"). The main related factor of this disease is the degeneration of retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) and vitreous membrane (Bruch's membrane). The so-called atrophic type is an atrophic lesion in the macular area caused by choroidal capillary atrophy, glass membrane thickening, and retinal pigment epithelium atrophy; the exudative type is mainly RPE atrophy, where the glass membrane is destroyed, and choroidal blood vessels grow into the retina to form a new vascular membrane. Recently, it has also been believed that: subretinal neovascularization originates under the pigmented epithelium and breaks through the glass membrane and grows down to the choroid; subretinal neovascularization exudes and bleeds, resulting in serous and hemorrhagic detachment of the retina and pigment epithelium; new blood vessels become fibrotic and form scars; when the amount of bleeding is large and acute, they can break through the anterior limiting membrane of the retina and enter the vitreous cavity."}

It repairs wounds, restores blood flow to injured tissue, maintains a woman's menstrual cycle, helps establish the placenta and maintains fetal growth during pregnancy, and is necessary for normal pathophysiological processes. However, new blood vessels grow where they should not grow, causing damage to the tissue. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as a vascular permeability factor, plays an important role in blood vessel growth. VEGF can stimulate the growth of vascular endothelial cells and increase vascular permeability, which can be up-regulated by factors such as hypoxia. Abnormal expression of VEGF plays a key role in the growth of solid tumors and in vasogenic retinopathies such as age-related macular degeneration. The use of a specific anti-VEGF antibody can prevent the VEGF molecule from binding to its receptor, thereby inhibiting the activity of VEGF and achieving three therapeutic effects, namely anti-vascular growth, anti-penetration and anti-inflammatory effects. Two such antibodies, Avastin (aka rhuMAb) and Lucentis (aka rhuFabV2), have been used clinically."}

{"title":"Section 3 Retinal hemangiomatous hyperplasia","text":"Since 1992, people have begun to understand the nature of new blood vessels in the retina. In 2001, Yannuzzi summarized previous experience and named the disease retinal angiomatous proliferation (RAP). The disease is divided into three phases. The first intraretinal neovascularization (IRN), the second subretinal neovascularization (SRN), and the third choroidal neovascularization (CNV). The first stage is seen in early cases. In the paracula area, new blood vessels proliferate in the deep capillary plexus, and retinal blood vessels are often connected to the new blood vessels, forming retina-retina anastomoses (RRA). Some people call it neovascular complex. Small bleeding and localized edema are often complicated. This period is often ignored because it may have little impact on the patient's vision or doctors have insufficient understanding. In the second stage, new blood vessels in the retina grow vertically and in both directions and grow inward to the retinal surface to form preretinal hemorrhage. At this time, age-related macular degeneration is often clinically diagnosed, and the new blood vessels are mistakenly believed to come from the choroid. New blood vessels grow outward under the retina, exacerbating intraretinal edema, and can also cause localized retinal detachment or even serous pigment epithelium detachment. In the third stage, the new blood vessels grow to the pigmented subepitis and are anastomosed with retina-choroid anastomoses (RCA)."}
{"title":"Section 3 Retinal hemangiomatous hyperplasia","text":"Fundus fluorescein angiography (FFA), especially indocyanine green angiography (ICGA), is helpful in diagnosis. The neovascular complex shows localized high fluorescent spots, which are hot spots. The horizontal position and size of hot spots can be determined. Serous pigment epithelial detachment appears as uniform round or oblong areas of high fluorescence. It would be better to combine OCT examination at this time. On OCT examination, hot spots appear as highlights. The detachment of pigment epithelium is manifested as an arcuate bulge inward in the light band of the pigment epithelium and choroidal capillary layer, and behind the light band is a dark area without light reflection. Afterwards, the choroid light band is covered. If the high light reflection point is located on the inside of the pigment epithelium detachment area, it is certain that the neovascular complex is located in the retina. OCT can determine the longitudinal and deep position of the neovascular complex. It is also very helpful for diagnosis. The first and second stages can still be diagnosed through the above examinations. Once it enters the third stage and anastomoses with choroidal neovascularization, it will be difficult to distinguish the source of the neovascularization."}

Whether the source of subretinal effusion comes from the choroid, vitreous or cerebrospinal fluid is still controversial. In 1988, Lincoff observed with a retinoscopy that retinal schisis occurred first in the macula area, followed by secondary retinal detachment. After examining this patient with OCT, the author found that there were cases with simple retinal clefts without detachment in the macula area, and there were retinal detachments that were connected to the clefts chamber or not, which were far more diverse than we imagined.

Those that are completely missing from the inner limiting membrane to the optic cell layer are called full-layer tears; those that still have some tissue layers intact are called laminar tears. It can be seen in a variety of causes, such as trauma (blunt ocular contusion, laser accident, solar eclipse and other radiation damage); degenerative myopia and high myopia; secondary to internal eye lesions (such as cystoid macular degeneration, central retinal vein occlusion, macular retina and choroidal disease, diabetic maculopathy, etc.); macular holes without obvious causes, except fundus diseases, are called idiopathic age-related macular holes. Idiopathic senile macular holes account for a large proportion of all macular hole cases. After Gass proposed in 1988 that vitreous traction was the key to tear formation, this view was supported by more and more researchers. Gass believes that the vitreous cortex undergoes liquefaction and posterior detachment due to certain biological changes. Because the inner limiting membrane at the fovea is more fragile than other parts, it is most closely attached to the posterior interface of the vitreous. If there is pathological adhesion and the posterior vitreous detachment is incomplete, it is easy to cause tangential traction to the fovea retina, and a full-thickness hole in the fovea retina will gradually form."}

Under the slit lamp microscope, vitreous opacity, liquefaction, complete or incomplete posterior detachment can be found. An operculum with varying transparency is seen in most cases at the post-detachment interface, mostly located near the hiatus, and a Weiss ring can also be seen in a few cases. Inspect the tear with a narrow light band. If the light band only becomes thinner and not interrupted at the tear, there is no ring halo (or very narrow) at the tear edge, there is no significant difference between the base of the tear and the surrounding retina, and the patient's eyes on the light band without interruption, it is a laminar tear; if the light band is interrupted and there is a significant difference from the retina at the edge of the hole, and the patient is told to watch the light band and the light band is interrupted, it is a full-layer tear, and there are often ring halo around the full-layer tear. If the halo is wide and the rim of the tear is tilted, indicating the presence of local retinal detachment, the lower peripheral fundus needs to be fully dilated to determine whether there is a low-level retinal detachment."}

The fundus manifestations of the macular area are similar to those of idiopathic macular holes, with fundus changes of the primary disease. As mentioned above, secondary macular holes can be secondary to a variety of diseases, so the mechanisms of occurrence vary. In traumatic cases, external force produces a sudden pulling force on the posterior polar retina, and the retina lacks corresponding elasticity, thus causing traumatic macular holes. In highly myopic eyes, atrophy and thinning of the posterior polar retina and choroid are important risk factors for the development of macular holes. Long-term traction of the epimacular membrane on the macular area can cause traction macular holes. In addition, long-term cystoid macular edema caused by various reasons can cause atrophy and thinning of the retina in the macular area, and ultimately lead to the formation of macular holes. Inflammatory diseases of the retina can also cause the formation of macular holes."}

Secondary macular hole","text":"Prognosis and treatment: A few patients with traumatic macular holes can heal spontaneously, but most of them persist for a long time and rarely cause retinal detachment. Whether surgical treatment is needed needs to be decided based on the specific circumstances. If there is no other damage to the optic nerve and macular area, the surgical treatment method and prognosis are similar to those for idiopathic macular holes. Macular holes caused by high myopia often cause macular hole retinal detachment. Because the posterior pole often has atrophic lesions of the choroid and pigment epithelium, although the retina can be repositioned after surgery, the visual prognosis is poor, which is related to the degree of macular atrophy. Surgical treatment of macular holes caused by macular membrane has a good prognosis. There is no effective treatment for retinal and choroidal atrophic macular holes in the macular area caused by other causes. Although retinal detachment is rarely caused, the visual prognosis is poor."}

During FFA examination, the yellow stripe was located on the ridge and showed high fluorescent bands due to RPE pigment atrophy. The black stripe is located at the bottom of the valley and the RPE gathers to block the fluorescence and appears black. Follows can occur due to a variety of diseases, such as retrobulbar masses, scleritis, scleral cingulate, choroidal masses, hypotony, choroidal neovascularization, and idiopathic diseases for which the cause cannot be determined."}

As the name suggests, the cause of the disease is unknown. The lesion is located in the choroid and is a polypoid vascular lesion. Some people think it is a special type of new blood vessel. In the past, the disease was often misdiagnosed as age-related macular degeneration. In Asian people, most patients with this disease are men over 50 years old, and most of the lesions are located in the macula. In the United States, most patients are black women, and most of the lesions are located near the optic disc. A dark red round protuberance can be seen in the macula of the fundus, with serous and\/or hemorrhagic retinal and\/or pigment epithelium detachment. ICGA examination showed clusters of round high-fluorescent spots (polypoid neovascularization) with or without vascular branches connecting them. In hemorrhagic retinal or pigment epithelium detachment, bleeding fluid levels are also visible. Polypoid neovascularization is different from the small, branching neovascularization in age-related macular degeneration. If the new blood vessels of this disease are not in the center of the macula, vision is expected to partially recover after the hemorrhage and edema are absorbed. The visual prognosis is better than that of age-related macular degeneration. The diagnostic standards of the Japanese PCV Research Group are available for reference.

{"title":"Section 10: Occult Macular Dystrophy","text":"Occult macular dystrophy (OMD) is a new disease that has only been recognized in the past 20 years. The disease was first reported by Miyake and colleagues in 1989 under the title \"Hereditary Macular Dystrophy without Fundus Changes\". They found that three patients in two generations from one family had normal fundus. Only local ERG or mfERG examination revealed impaired macular function. In 1996, the author found 13 patients from 8 families, once again confirming the clinical characteristics of the disease and recommending the name of the current disease. It is characterized by progressive decline in vision, while imaging examinations such as fundus and fundus fluorescein angiography are normal, and only multifocal electroretinogram is abnormal. The disease was often misdiagnosed as retrobulbar optic neuritis or amblyopia in the past. Some unnecessary brain CT examinations, as well as unnecessary corticosteroid pulse therapy, should attract our attention and attention."}
{"title":"Section 10: Occult Macular Dystrophy","text":"In Miyake's case, the patients had progressive vision loss, and half had a family history. Another author reported that the patient had no family history and no progress in his condition. Among Miyake's OMD cases, one case had normal fundus after 14 years of observation, with no significant changes in ERG but worsening on local ERG examination. He speculated that OMD might not produce extensive cone cell damage. Since 2005, we have conducted clinical observations and found that this disease does exist in Chinese people. We observed the latency and amplitude density of the waves in rings 1 and 2. Compared with normal control eyes, the latency period was prolonged and the amplitude density was decreased, with significant differences. There was no significant difference in wave latency and amplitude density between the affected eyes and the control eyes in other rings. From a small number of patients we followed up, it was found that in addition to the amplitude density of mfERG, which may continue to decrease, the amplitude of b-wave in photopic ERG seemed to decrease. Therefore, OMD may be a type of cone cell dystrophy, or simply the cone cell damage is mild or the damage is limited to the central area, or it may be at different stages of the disease, congenital or acquired or both, which are all subject to further exploration and verification."}
{"title":"Section 11 Retinal pigment epithelium tear","text":"When the choroidal neovascular membrane is separated with serous retinal pigment epithelium, the hydrostatic pressure is often different due to the presence of the neovascular membrane in the detachment lumen, resulting in the detachment surface being often uneven. If photocoagulation is performed at this time, the pressure in the detachment lumen will rise unevenly, which may lead to tearing of the pigment epithelium, and the torn edge will curl up towards the membranous part. The patient felt a sudden decline in vision because fluid from the subdermal layer of the pigment flowed into the subdermal layer of the nerve and formed a neuroepithelial detachment. Fluid can be gradually absorbed through the regeneration of unpigmented pigment epithelium covering the tear area and the atrophy of some choroidal capillaries. Regardless of whether serous retinal pigment epithelium detachment is associated with new vascular membranes, if it exists for a long time, the pigment epithelium may atrophy, and there is a possibility that pigment epithelium tears may occur spontaneously. In addition, vitreous resection was performed for intraocular hemorrhage, including subcutaneous hemorrhage combined with vitreous hemorrhage, and pigment epithelium tears could also be seen after surgery. When performing fluorescence imaging examination, uneven high fluorescence was seen at the membrane of the new blood vessel. The tear showed a uniform high fluorescence area, and the choroidal vessels could be seen through. The edge on one side was often clear, and at the curled part of the pigment epithelium on the other side, a low fluorescence edge was sometimes visible."}

They found that this group of patients presented with macular microcystic degeneration without macular holes and retinal thickening under slit lamp microscopy, but OCT showed retinal schisis. According to the performance of OCT, it can be divided into outer layer cleavage, which is cleaved in the photoreceptor cell layer of the retina, with the inner layer of the retina thick and the outer layer thin; inner layer cleavage: the inner layer of the cleaved retina thin and the outer layer thick. It can also manifest as foveal cysts, laminar rifts, and foveal detachment. A few macular clefts with traction of the posterior polar vitreous body later developed into full-thickness macular holes. The cause of macular retinoschisis is unknown, but may be related to factors such as vitreous traction macula, retroscleral stuloma, and retinal cystoid degeneration."}

{"title":"Section 9 Small mouth disease","text":"Oguchi's disease is a congenital static night blindness. The patient had night blindness since childhood, but did not progress. Vision, visual field, and color vision were normal. Under light adaptation, the fundus is gold leaf-like yellow at the posterior pole or (and) the periphery, and the arteries and veins are similar in color and are like embossed. Under dark adaptation, the fundus returns to normal color after half an hour to several hours, which is called Mizuphenon. The patient had a genetic mutation that led to abnormalities in the rhodopsin inhibitory protein (arrestin,S antigen) and rhodopsin kinase. Phototransduction is the process in which retinoic molecules in photoreceptor cells capture photons and produce electrical reactions. Under normal circumstances, rhodopsin absorbs photons and is activated and activates transduction proteins, which activate phosphodiesterase, hydrolyze cGMP, and ultimately change the release rate of neurotransmitters at the end of the synapse. At the same time, activated rhodopsin is phosphorylated under the action of rhodopsin kinase and is inactivated after binding to inhibitor proteins. Abnormality of rhodopsin kinase and inhibitory protein leads to abnormal dark adaptation time in patients with smallmouth disease. Fluorescence angiography was normal. Electroretinogram showed that cone cell reactions were normal, rod cell reactions decreased or lost, cone and rod cell mixed reactions showed negative waveforms, and OPS waveforms were well preserved. The disease is autosomal recessive inheritance and is relatively rare."}

{"title":"Section 1 Outer exudative retinopathy","text":"Outer exudative retinopathy, also known as Coats 'disease, is a dysplastic disease of small retinal blood vessels. The core lesion is abnormal structure of small blood vessels, mainly manifested by abnormal expansion of capillaries, sometimes accompanied by tumor-like expansion of small arteries, tortuosity and dilation of small veins, and changes in vascular sheath. These abnormal vascular changes are most common in the temporal side. On the basis of abnormal blood vessels, edema, exudation and hemorrhage can occur between the retinal layers, of which the yellow-white hard exudation is the most important and eye-catching. Initially, these exudates are located near abnormal blood vessels, and then gradually expand to the posterior pole, reaching the macula area, which affects the patient's vision. It is worth noting that sometimes relatively isolated hard oozing spots or nodules appear in the macula area, or even organize. Careful search of the surrounding fundus reveals primary vascular changes. As the course of the disease extends, exudation and edema can spread throughout the retina, leading to exudative retinal detachment. Long-term exudative changes can also occur in subretinal cholesterol crystallization and the formation of peripheral retinal cysts. Retinal hemorrhage and hyperplasia are rare in untreated cases, and new blood vessels are even rarer."}
{"title":"Section 1 Outer exudative retinopathy","text":"Since abnormalities and exudation of retinal blood vessels can occur in a variety of vascular diseases, Coats 'disease should be differentiated from a variety of vascular diseases. A very important point is that the primary vascular changes in Coats 'disease are currently considered to be idiopathic and have no clear known cause. Therefore, when diagnosing Coats' disease, attention should be paid to looking for signs of other vascular diseases and excluding existing primary diseases. A diagnosis can be made only after the disease. For this reason, the diagnosis of Coats should be extremely cautious when it comes to extensive exudative fundus disease that occurs in adulthood. In addition, attention should also be paid to observe whether the abnormalities of blood vessels are consistent with the fundus changes of exudation and edema and the course of disease. Coats 'disease most commonly occurs in adolescent men, mostly in one eye, which also helps in differential diagnosis."}
{"title":"Section 1 Outer exudative retinopathy","text":"FFA is very helpful in the diagnosis of Coats 'disease. The abnormally changed capillaries, arterioles, and venules were particularly clearly displayed on the imaging film. Typical changes are fish-net-like expansion of capillaries, uneven diameter and tumor-like expansion of arterioles, microhemangioma and non-perfusion areas can be seen around the abnormally expanded vessels, and rarely accompanied by retinal neovascularization. With the extension of imaging time, fluorescence leakage gradually occurred in the lesion area. Patients with secondary retinal detachment can see extensive dilatation and leakage of small blood vessels outside the abnormal vascular area, and some patients also have strong fluorescence on the optic disc. It should be noted that due to the limited scope of imaging, abnormal blood vessels in some patients are located in the periphery of the fundus and cannot be observed in FFA. At this time, clear fundus signs are the key to diagnosis."}
{"title":"Section 2 Parafular telangiectasia","text":"Parafular telangiectasia is a rare disease with unclear etiology. Patients often have no known systemic and local ocular diseases. It is more common in the elderly, with slight decline in vision. The fundus shows telangiectasia, occlusion, and microhemangioma formation in the macula area, with mild edema, exudation, and patchy hemorrhage around it. FFA showed that capillary dilatation and occlusion existed in the macula area, microhemangioma formed, and fluorescein gradually leaked over time. There were no other known abnormal fundus changes either by fundus fundus examination or angiography."}
{"title":"Section 2 Parafular telangiectasia","text":"This disease and Coats 'disease are both idiopathic abnormal diseases of small fundus vessels, but the lesions are different in locations and degrees and are easy to distinguish. There is no history of diabetes and the progression of diabetic retinopathy, which can be distinguished from diabetic retinopathy."}
{"title":"Section 3 Retinopathy of Prematurity","text":"Retinopathy of prematurity (ROP) is also called immature retinopathy. At birth, retinal blood vessels do not reach the temporal periphery but continue to grow. This process will not be completed until 39 to 40 weeks. If you are born prematurely at 32 weeks and then take oxygen, the still growing blood vessels are particularly sensitive to oxygen and a series of vascular occlusive lesions can occur. Therefore, risk factors for developing this disease are birth weight less than 1500mg and a history of oxygen inhalation. In 1984, the International ROP Conference established standards for expressing the lesion site and disease stage. The lesion site is divided into areas: Area I: A circle drawn with a radius of twice the distance from the optic disc to the macula. Zone II: The circle drawn from the optic disc to the nasal serration margin as the radius. Zone III: The area outside zone to the temporal serration margin. It is divided into 5 stages according to the progress of the disease: \u2460 The dividing line period: There is an arc-shaped white dividing line at the end of the temporal peripheral lesion.\u2461 Cristal formation stage: The white strips widen and bulge, and blood vessels grow in, turning pink.\u2462 Proliferation stage: Fibrovascular tissue grows into and extends to the vitreous body.\u2463 Retinal detachment period: Retinal detachment occurs due to exudation and\/or traction. If partial detachment does not involve the macula, it is 4A, and if the macula has been involved, it is 4B.\u2462 Total retinal detachment: Treatment with condensation or laser photocoagulation during the proliferative period can prevent the progression of the disease."}

In the lighter case, only the number of branches and the length of the blood vessels can be seen, and there is a gray V-shaped area pointing to the center of the macula in the mid-latitude part of the temporal side. In some patients, the drag of the optic disc is more obvious, that is, the great retinal vessels exiting the optic disc deflect to the temporal side, and the angle between the upper and lower vascular arches becomes sharp. Patients with severe vascular lesions can see changes such as exudation, edema, and cleavage near the abnormally dilated blood vessels in the temporal side. Patients can also develop exudative, traction, and rhegmatogenous retinal detachments."}

{"title":"Chapter 14 Fundus manifestations of inflammatory and parasitic diseases","text":"The choroid is rich in blood vessels and is closely connected to the ciliary body and retina. Pathogens such as bacteria can spread through blood circulation or adjacent tissues, causing inflammation of the choroid and retina. There are multiple classifications of chorioretinitis. According to the degree of inflammatory response, there are acute suppurative and chronic granulomatous (such as tuberculous). According to the site of inflammation, chororetinitis is divided into diffuse, disseminated and localized. Limitations can be divided into central, peripheral (intermediate uveitis) or near-paraoptic disc (Jensen disease). According to pathogens, they are divided into bacterial (including causing specific inflammation such as tuberculosis, syphilitic, toxoplasmosis, Lyme disease), viral and fungal. We also include ocular complications of porcine cysticercosis in this chapter. Due to the different nature of pathogens, their toxicity is different, and the inflammatory response varies greatly. In severe cases, endophthalmitis can be caused. Early diagnosis and early reasonable antibiotic treatment are extremely important for saving vision. Various eye disease manifestations are described below."}

Some believe that inflammation originates from the ciliary body and choroid, others believe it originates from the blood vessels of the retina. In mild cases, exudation, hemorrhage, white sheath and even occlusion of blood vessels, and pigmentation can be seen around the surroundings. Severe cases have snow bank-like exudation and proliferative lesions, causing ciliary membrane formation, traction retinal detachment, and concurrent cataracts. Three-mirror and indirect ophthalmoscope pressure examination are extremely important. Gray KP, optic disc and macula edema were also seen.

{"title":"Section 10: Tuberculous choroiditis","text":"Ocular surface tissue can be directly invaded by tubercle bacillus to cause primary tuberculosis, while tuberculosis in ocular tissue is a disseminated infection of lesions in other parts of the body. Compared with other tissues in the eye, the choroidal tissue has a larger blood vessel diameter, a larger number, and rich blood flow, so it is most likely to accept tuberculosis bacteria in the circulation system. Due to the different number, virulence, and reaction status of body tissues of bacteria disseminated into the choroid, the manifestations of tuberculosis lesions in the choroid can vary greatly. Among them, the most common manifestation is disseminated choroiditis, which is most common in young and middle-aged patients and is often bilateral. The diameter and number of disseminated lesions vary greatly. The lesion is deep in the choroid and appears yellow, white or gray, with basically clear boundaries. Most patients have the lesion at the posterior pole, and disc edema with hemorrhage of the nerve fiber layer can be seen. Corresponding anterior uveitis can be mild, severe, or absent. Another common form of tuberculous choroiditis is focal choroiditis, which forms a solitary tuberculoma of the choroid. In such patients, although a small number of satellite lesions may be present, a single choroidal mass is a characteristic change. Large tuberculosis lesions have obvious localized protuberances, with a diameter of several optic discs, yellow-white or gray-white in color, blurred edges, and retinal hemorrhage and exudative detachment may occur on and around the surface. Another rare form of tuberculous choroidal disease is acute miliary tuberculosis, which is part of the systemic miliary tuberculosis.

Atrophic holes are often ruptures based on staphyloma of the posterior sclera and cystoid macular degeneration in high myopia. They are generally round or oval in shape, and often lack a hole cover membrane. The tear hole can be the result of trauma or idiopathic vitreous traction. It has an irregular shape and can be slit, crescent or horseshoe shaped in the early stage. A complete tear can be irregular round or oval in shape. A full-layer cover membrane floats on the posterior limiting membrane of the vitreous in front of the tear. Because this cap membrane shrinks less than the tear and because its opacity is obvious, it can be distinguished from the lamellar cap membrane with the inner layer of cystoid macular degeneration torn. The latter is a transparent membrane. Because it shrinks like a small floating object, it is difficult to discover and can only be seen under a microscope."}

Due to the presence of large areas of pigment epithelium exposure, it is easy to produce pigment epithelium cells (RPE) free and cause proliferation around the retina. Due to factors such as gravity and body position, RPE hyperplasia occurs at the lower end of the tear and the inverted posterior flap, forming annular and longitudinal retinal folds, and further contracting until the posterior flap is curled and folded like a purse opening or swept. In addition, it can also cause hyperplasia on the posterior surface of the retina, forming a napkin ring proliferative membrane. At the same time, the intraretinal tissue repair reaction caused by the huge retinal tear causes the entire retina to thicken, stiffen, and shorten, so that there seems to be no membrane entanglement on the surface, which belongs to intraretinal hyperplasia. Surgical treatment of this huge retinal tear with multiple hyperplasia is extremely difficult."}

Early retinal tears show only as localized raised retinal echoes that are not smooth, and some localized fractures can be detected. The tear located at the periphery of the eyeball can be externally pressurized by using a scleral compressor at the corresponding position, so that the tear can be explored more clearly.

The edge of the tear near the non-defect area is tilted, and the central edge near the defect area is attached to the sclera. Due to the structural differences between the retina near the margin and the center side of the defect area, the single retina near the center margin fused with the sclera at the bottom of the defect fovea. Therefore, one side of the hole edge is high and the other side is low. Such holes account for the majority. In the second type of defect area, the lower part of the arch ring was not formed. During the operation, it was inferred that it was a macular hole based on the light yellow color displayed by the upper part of the arch ring and lutein. The third type is atrophic holes.

We used OCT to find that it appeared similar to the congenital optic disc fovea, but more severe than the fovea. The defect around the optic disc is smaller than the concave area. In addition to serous retinal detachment and\/or cleavage often seen on the temporal side of the optic disc, such changes can also be seen above and below the optic disc. The extent of detachment and cleavage is much wider than the concavity. Simply photocoagulation on the edge of the optic disc is not effective. Vitrectomy combined with intraocular gas or silicone oil filling combined with photocoagulation is better than photocoagulation alone. However, recurrence can still occur after surgery.

Entering the era of phacoemulsification, although the operation has been simplified and the incision is only 1 - 3.2 mm, the disease is still not completely immune. Since surgical operations are mostly performed on the upper half of the eyeball, retinal breaks often occur at the upper surgical site. One or more small cracks or small holes or serrated margins occur in the peripheral or serrated margin of the retina above the temporal and nasal nose, which then causes local detachment or superior detachment of the supratemporal or nasal upper limit and may extend below the retina. Clinical manifestations include rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. The difference is that the adhesion between the pupil and the capsule or the intraocular lens is often difficult to disperse, and it is difficult to inspect the tear and freeze the tear."}

It is called choroidal detachment type retinal detachment. The disease has an acute onset and develops rapidly. It is generally accompanied by obvious uveitis and hypotony. Retinal detachment is accompanied by ciliary body and choroid detachment. It is generally believed that hypotony caused by choroidal circulation disorder is the basic factor in the development of this disease. If not treated in time, the destruction of the blood-retinal barrier will not be improved, and various growth factors entering the vitreous body can quickly lead to widespread proliferation of the vitreous body and around the retina, and severe PVR will occur in a short period of time, causing difficulty in treatment and poor prognosis."}

After treatment with glucocorticoids, the retinal detachment bulge became higher as the choroidal detachment gradually absorbed. If severe PVR occurs, the retina becomes stiff and has extensive fixed folds.

This disease is caused by congenital abnormal structure and composition of the sclera, abnormal thickening of the sclera, and poor development of vortex veins, which affects the outflow of protein fluid in the eye and collects high-protein fluid in the choroid to form a hyperosmolar state. In turn, choroid thickening occurs, and fluid accumulation occurs in the ciliary body and suprachoroidal space, which then further overflows under the retina, causing retinal detachment.

Circular detachment of the ciliary body and choroid and retinal detachment with movable non-rhegmatogenous subfluid can be combined. Because its pathogenesis is also abnormal thickening of the sclera and its pathological changes are similar, sclerectomy is also adopted when dealing with choroid and retinal detachment. Anti-glaucoma surgery is often combined with lens extraction surgery."}

{"title":"Section 5 Traction retinal detachment  1. proliferative diabetic retinopathy","text":"When the retinopathy reaches a certain degree of ischemia and hypoxia, new blood vessels in the retina or optic disc can be produced. Once new blood vessels progress, fibroplastic membranes follow. The predilection site of hyperplastic membrane is the optic disc and the upper and lower vascular arches, and can also be seen on the nasal side of the optic disc. At first, the hyperplastic membrane was grayish white and translucent, and gradually thickened to become dense white. New blood vessels were accompanying the membrane and protruding towards the vitreous body. Contraction of the proliferative membrane can cause bleeding and retinal detachment. The detachment starts from the optic disc along the upper and lower vascular arches to the temporal side of the macula, forming an annular or incomplete annular detachment ring. The macula can be spared or separated by pulling. If visual acuity is reduced with macula involvement, vitrectomy should be considered."}
{"title":"Section 5 Traction retinal detachment  2. Retinal periphlebitis","text":"Although the disease is called periphlebitis, in fact, there is inflammation not only around the blood vessels but also in the wall itself. Not only the veins but also the arteries can also be affected. The affected veins may have one or more branches with uneven diameter. Within their distribution range, there may be bleeding, exudation, white sheath of the blood vessel and subsequent vascular occlusion, resulting in non-perfusion areas and new blood vessels. New blood vessels can be bled and organized, which in turn causes traction retinal detachment. When the retina is pulled for a long time, a small round tear is often formed at the bottom of the detachment edge. In this way, on the basis of traction retinal detachment, rhegmatogenous retinal detachment can be combined."}
{"title":"Section 6 Choroidal detachment","text":"The anterior end of the choroid is attached to the continuity of the ciliary body and the sclera. It is closely attached to the sclera where the vortex vein exits the sclera at the equatorial part and where the ciliary artery around the optic disc enters the choroid through the sclera. There is a potential gap between the two parts, and liquid or blood can accumulate to form serous or hemorrhagic choroidal detachment, often complicated by ciliary body detachment. Choroidal detachment is mainly seen in: \u2460 After intraocular surgery: including anti-glaucoma filtration surgery, cataract extraction, retinal detachment surgery, penetrating keratoplasty and sudden decrease in intraocular pressure after ocular trauma, which can increase blood vessel permeability and accumulate liquid in the suprachoroidal space; Choroidal circulation disorders: such as the obstruction of vortex vein return after posterior scleral cerclage, increased hydrostatic pressure in the choroidal capillaries, and fluid leakage;\u2462 Increased choroidal vascular permeability caused by inflammation."}
{"title":"Section 6 Choroidal detachment","text":"Binocular indirect ophthalmoscopy is the most useful tool for diagnosing choroidal detachment, observing clinical outcome and selecting treatment methods. In the early stage of choroidal detachment, especially when combined with ciliary detachment, the serrated margin or pars plana of the ciliary body can be seen without scleral compression. There are band-like blurred or rippling folds near the serrated margin, and the horizontal direction is obvious. The lesion progressed and a gray-brown or brown-black, opaque and well-defined bulge appeared on the periphery of the fundus. There was no feeling of fluctuations and the surface was smooth. The retina on the surface was normal and there was no detachment, and the normal texture of the choroid was not visible. Choroidal detachment varies in size, height, and shape. The extensive one can be hemispherical. Due to the separation of vortex veins, the choroidal detachment is divided and can be expressed as several restricted spherical protuberances, with deep valleys between each protuberances. Generally, the nasal and temporal detachment area is large and the degree of protuberance is high, while the upper and lower detachment area is small. Choroidal detachment at the posterior pole often appears flat, with corrugated or radial surface, and linear folds."}

If the detachment time is long, spotted, granular or line-like pigmentation may be left in the fundus. If the choroidal detachment does not improve after medical treatment, or other complications occur, such as the choroidal detachment balls contact each other, there is a risk of traction retinal detachment, or secondary glaucoma, or the detachment extensively involves the posterior pole and affects the recovery of central vision. In this case, you can position it under direct vision of a binocular indirect ophthalmoscope, and open the sclera at the highest point of detachment to drain the fluid from the suprachoroidal space."}
{"title":"Chapter 16 Optic Nerve Diseases","text":"The optic nerve connects the eye and cerebral nerves, so its disease has the characteristics of a disease of the eye and cerebral nervous system. Optic nerve disease can be caused by congenital and acquired factors such as inflammation, blood supply disorders, trauma and other diseases, as well as by adjacent paranasal sinus disease in the eye and orbit. Optic nerve disease can cause decreased vision, specific visual field changes, and fundus changes. Its diseases are also very complicated. The details are as follows."}
{"title":"Section 1: Optic disc inflammation and optic disc retinitis","text":"If the inflammation is confined to the optic disc, it is called optic disc inflammation. If there is inflammation around the optic disc, macula and even the posterior pole, it is called optic disc retinitis. The clinical manifestation of optic disc inflammation is: sharp decline in vision. The optic disc is red, the capillaries on the surface are dilated, the boundaries are unclear and edema, the bulge generally does not exceed 3 diopters, and there is hemorrhage and exudation around the optic disc. The veins were tortuous and dilated. If inflammation affects the retina and macula, the retina and macula are edema. Some astrograms or radial folds can also be seen on the nasal side of the macula. Secondary optic nerve atrophy is often left on the optic disc after inflammation resolves. Central scotoma is often found in visual field examinations."}

{"title":"Section 2 Disc edema","text":"Disc edema usually refers to passive disc edema caused by increased intracranial pressure, regardless of the existence of pathogenic factors of the disc itself."}
{"title":"Section 2 Disc edema","text":"The disease may manifest as paroxysmal temporary blurred vision, or it may also have symptoms such as headache, nausea, and vomiting. Fundus examination showed that the edge of the optic disc was blurred and raised, which could exceed 3 diopters or even reach 8 diopters. The optic disc was red and appeared enlarged. The physiological depression becomes shallower, or even disappears before protruding into a mushroom shape. Hemorrhage and white spots around the optic disc. Yellow arc-shaped stripes and folds can also be seen next to the optic disc. The arteries are normal or slightly thinned. The veins were tortuous and dilated. Edema and incomplete astrogram are visible in the macula. The visual field examination showed an enlarged physiological blind spot. If the lesion involves the macula, central scotoma can also be seen. There is also another clinically noteworthy condition, that is, some cases have optic disc edema, but there are no positive signs of the nervous system such as increased intracranial pressure, clear cerebrospinal fluid, and normal cells and chemical components. Call it a pseudobrain tumor. Disc edema can persist over the years and good vision can be maintained for a long time. Of course, disc edema can eventually lead to optic nerve atrophy and impaired vision."}
{"title":"Section 2 Disc edema","text":"Diseases that cause optic disc edema (papilledema) include: orbital space-occupying lesions, dural arteriovenous flaccidity, idiopathic elevated intracranial pressure, intracranial venous sinus thrombosis, cerebral cysticercosis increased intracranial pressure, optic nerve sheath tumor, etc."}

{"title":"Section 3 Ischemic optic disc lesions","text":"This is an independent disease that has only been recognized in recent years. As the name suggests, optic disc lesions are caused by ischemia. Although the lesions manifest at the optic disc, the extent of ischemia is often not limited to the optic disc, but often involves the cribriform plate and the posterior cribriform plate nerves. Therefore, this disease is also called anterior ischemic optic neuropathy. Patients often complain of a dark area below or above the front of their eyes. Central vision was mostly unaffected or slightly decreased. Fundus examination showed asymmetrical edema or atrophy of varying degrees above or below the optic disc. Asymmetrical retinal edema, hemorrhage and exudation above and below the optic disc are a major feature of the disease. This is due to the fact that both the optic disc and peridisc are supplied by the ciliary blood vessels. Visual field examination has a fan shaped visual field defect connected to the blind spot that often bypasses the central fixation area. Once the black shadow in the defect area appears, it can fade away over time, but it will not disappear."}
{"title":"Section 3 Ischemic optic disc lesions","text":"The disease can affect both eyes, and both eyes often develop one after another. If the time between the two episodes is long, the optic nerve atrophy in one eye and the optic disc edema in the other eye will appear. Quite similar to Foster-Kennedy syndrome. Pay attention to distinguishing it from true Foster-Kennedy syndrome caused by frontal lobe tumors."}
{"title":"Section 4 Optic nerve atrophy  1. Familial optic atrophy (Leber optic atrophy)","text":"Optic nerve atrophy is the ultimate common outcome of the optic nerve affected by multiple pathogenic factors such as inflammation, ischemia, trauma and poisoning systemic diseases such as rheumatism. The disease is further divided into primary and secondary. The former means that there is no disease that can cause atrophy in the eye, which is caused by retrobulbar optic neuropathy (including inflammation, ischemia, etc.). Fundus examination showed that the optic disc was pale or only the temporal side was pale (seen in retrobulbar optic neuritis). The number of capillaries on the optic disc decreased. The obvious atrophy is porcelain white and even the sieve plates can be seen. The boundaries are clear and the disk surface is clean. The latter refers to eye diseases that can cause atrophy in the eye, such as inflammation and degenerative diseases. The optic disc is yellow-white, with slightly filthy disc and often filled with hyperplasia, and the boundary is unclear. Yellow-white stripes or folds can be seen around the optic disc. Old exudation or bleeding can also be seen. White sheath is sometimes visible in blood vessels on the optic disc. Below are two brief descriptions of optic nerve atrophy that should be noted."}
{"title":"Section 4 Optic nerve atrophy  1. Familial optic atrophy (Leber optic atrophy)","text":"The disease mainly affects young men. Acute disease often occurs in both eyes, and vision drops sharply. Fundus examination showed dilatation of microvessels around the optic disc, swelling of the nerve fiber layer around the optic disc, and microaneurysms and hemorrhage could also be seen. But there was no fluorescein leakage. Over time, optic nerve atrophy progressed from pale temporal side to pale optic disc, and the retinal artery narrowed. Some patients 'vision drops to a trough and then slowly recovers. Visual field examination showed a large central dark spot, in which dark nuclei could also be found. Color vision examination mainly shows red and green color blindness."}
{"title":"Section 4 Optic nerve atrophy  1. Familial optic atrophy (Leber optic atrophy)","text":"The inheritance mode of this disease was previously considered to be a sex-linked genetic disease. In the 1980s, someone proposed the theory of mitochondrial inheritance. It is now known that human mtDNA has three different primary mutations, namely 11778, 3460, and 14484. In advanced cases, the entire optic disc is pale, and the microvessels around the optic disc can disappear. Mitochondrial examination can help diagnosis if it finds any of the three primary mutations."}
{"title":"Section 4 Optic nerve atrophy  2. Optic nerve atrophy after retrobulbar optic neuritis","text":"The retrobulbar optic nerve refers to the section of the optic nerve from behind the optic disc to before the optic chiasm. This section of the optic nerve develops lesions in the optic nerve due to various factors in the orbit and the brain such as inflammation, ischemia, trauma, etc., which is called retrobulbar optic neuritis or lesions. Existing people have proposed the word \"behind the bulbar\" or not, which refers to inflammation of the optic nerve behind the bulbar, and only optic neuritis can be used. We still added the word \"behind the ball\" in accordance with our habit."}
{"title":"Section 4 Optic nerve atrophy  2. Optic nerve atrophy after retrobulbar optic neuritis","text":"The disease is more common in young people (caused by demyelinating disease), and vision in one or both eyes drops sharply. Axial optic neuritis is the most common thing, so patients often feel central vision decline and central darkness. Fundus examination was normal. However, visual field examination showed central, paracentral or dumbbell-shaped scotoma. You can also see narrowing of the peripheral field of view or fan scotoma. After 2 to 3 months, sometimes the temporal side of the optic disc appears pale in color, which is a characteristic of inflammatory atrophy of axial optic neurone. At the same time, a tendency to recover vision is also one of the characteristics of the disease."}

Explanation: There are four main symptoms of this disease: diabetes insipidus, diabetes, optic atrophy and deafness. DIDMOAD disease"}
{"title":"Section 5 Optic disc drusen","text":"Primary optic disc drusen is more common in young people and develops in both eyes or one eye. It can also be divided into vitreous warts on the optic disc and buried vitreous warts. The drusen on the optic disc appears as small spherical, white or light yellow, transparent or translucent, single or multiple frog-ovoid or morula-shaped, protruding from the surface of the optic disc or even covering the optic disc. Buried drusen is located deep behind the optic disc. Make the optic disc bulge and appear to be uneven. Small hemorrhage around the optic disc or deep hemorrhage, especially on the nasal side, is often complicated. The retinal veins were slightly filled. Early vision is not affected. Due to compression of optic disc nerve fibers, corresponding defects may appear in the visual field. Attention should be paid to distinguishing it from true optic disc edema caused by elevated intracranial pressure. The disease can show autofluorescence. FFA showed low fluorescence in the early stage and fluorescence staining in the late stage, which was different from the full disc with true disc edema showing high fluorescence leakage and expansion."}
{"title":"Sixth holiday optic disc inflammation","text":"Pseudooptic disc inflammation is actually not a disease but a normal fundus. Because in hyperopia or myopia with oblique optic disc penetration, the edge of the optic disc does not look very clear, inflammatory edema of the optic disc is suspected. However, there were no edema, hemorrhage, exudation and other lesions around the optic disc. Fundus fluorescein angiography was performed to check that there were no leaks in the optic disc vessels and the vision was normal."}
{"title":"Chapter 17 Traumatic fundus lesions","text":"Fundus lesions caused by trauma can be complex and have diverse manifestations. Trauma can be divided into mechanical and non-mechanical. Mechanical injuries can be divided into penetrating and non-penetrating. Penetrating injuries may or may not be complicated by intrabulbar foreign bodies, and non-penetrating injuries may include retinal concussion, ocular contusion, etc. The above-mentioned injuries can also be complicated by intraocular inflammation, infection, hemorrhage, tissue rupture and injury. Non-mechanical injuries also have light damage caused by various light sources such as sunlight, light reflected by snow and microscope light sources. Radiation fundus lesions caused by far and short distance radiotherapy such as application radiotherapy. Traumatic fundus lesions cover a very rich range."}
{"title":"Section 1 Traumatic chorioretinopathy  1. Retinal concussion","text":"Retinal concussion is one of the common retinal contusions among ocular contusions, with retinal edema as the main feature. It was first described by Berlin in 1873, so it is also called Berlin edema. It can occur in the macula or other parts of the retina. Different degrees of retinal damage occur due to different magnitudes of blunt force and individual responses to blunt force. Clinically divided into mild and severe contusive retinal edema. The former is also called retinal concussion. Retinal edema can subside in a few weeks, and the edema is absorbed without leaving any traces. If the damage is severe, there will be pigment disorder or scar. The lesion is not in the macula area, and vision is often not affected. If the macula is involved, vision will be reduced to varying degrees. Severe contusive retinal edema may include sudden loss of vision, retinal hemorrhage and edema at the posterior pole, macular hemorrhage and edema, and choroid rupture and hemorrhage. If the lesion is in the macula area, it can lead to permanent visual function and vision damage, and organic changes in the retina."}
{"title":"Section 1 Traumatic chorioretinopathy  2. Traumatic vascular retinopathy (Purtscher's disease)","text":"It refers to retinopathy caused by trauma to other parts of the body (such as severe brain trauma, trunk crush injury, long bone fracture, etc.), also known as distant retinopathy. The lesions were mainly exudation and hemorrhage. Purtscher was first reported in 1910, so it is also called Purtscher retinopathy. Typical changes in the fundus are extensive retinal and macula edema, blurred disc boundaries, and edema may occur. Almost round milky white cotton-like exudation spots can be seen in the surrounding retina, which can be scattered or fused. A large amount of bleeding can be seen at the posterior pole and around the disc. Bleeding and exudation can enter the vitreous body. The exudation is generally absorbed in about 1 month. Optic nerve atrophy can occur in the later stage. Purtscher's retinopathy can also be seen in other diseases, such as acute pancreatitis and air embolism."}
{"title":"Section 1 Traumatic chorioretinopathy  3. Choroidal rupture and bleeding","text":"Like the mechanism for forming retinal concussions, external forces can also impact the choroid to cause choroid rupture. The fundus shows yellow-white stripes, which are arc-shaped and concave facing the optic disc. The stripes can be long or short, and the number can be large or small. The author once saw 1 case with as many as 5 to 6 streaks. Hemorrhage is often complicated at the striations, and the striations are covered, or even bleed into the vitreous body. Late repair, especially through rupture and fibrosis of the macula, permanently and severely impaired vision."}
{"title":"Section 1 Traumatic chorioretinopathy  4. Traumatic retinal hemorrhage","text":"Whether penetrating or non-penetrating trauma, the most common cause is retinal hemorrhage. Bleeding includes superficial bleeding in the form of strips and flames. There was also a dot shaped deep hemorrhage. If the hemorrhage is located in front of the retina or under the vitreous membrane, the hemorrhage takes a boat shape and a horizontal liquid surface is often visible. If the amount of bleeding is large, it can break through the vitreous membrane and enter the vitreous body. Can cause a sudden decline in vision."}
{"title":"Section 1 Traumatic chorioretinopathy  5. Valsalva retinopathy","text":"During lifting weights, defecation, severe coughing, and Valsalva manipulation (first closing the vocal cords and letting sudden force rush towards the Eustachian tube), the pressure in the chest and abdominal cavity suddenly rises, which then causes a sudden increase in intraocular venous pressure, causing spontaneous rupture of capillaries on the inner surface of the retina, further causing hemorrhagic detachment of the internal limiting membrane and vitreous hemorrhage. This often causes sudden decline in vision. Round or dumbbell-shaped bleeding with clear boundaries and bright red mound-like elevations can be seen in the macula at the fundus. If the amount of bleeding is large, red blood cells will be deposited on the horizontal liquid surface below. Occasionally, the above situation can be seen in healthy people who have no history of sudden exertion. Some patients may have retinal vascular diseases such as diabetes and high blood pressure. Some people have a history of fundus hemorrhage and reduced vision. The prognosis of the disease is good. Vision is expected to recover after the bleeding is absorbed."}
{"title":"Section 2 optic nerve tear and avulsion","text":"This disease can occur when the optic nerve is strongly pushed and pulled backward from the scleral canal. The following conditions are observed: \u2460 The eyeball rotates extremely and moves forward;\u2461 Orbital penetrating trauma pushes the optic nerve backward;\u2462 A sudden increase in intraocular pressure leads to rupture of the cribriform plate. Tear of the optic nerve of the cribriform plate and disc rim can occur in all three cases. If there is a partial tear, there is a limited posterior depression at the tear of the optic disc. It's a bit similar to the congenital optic disc fovea. If the depression is covered by bleeding, it can only be seen after the bleeding has been absorbed. The retinal blood vessels corresponding to the tear often become thinner. There are often multiple blood spots around the nipple. If it is complete, it is avulsion. A deep black hole appears at the optic disc. Extensive retinal hemorrhage and even vitreous hemorrhage are often complicated. In advanced stages, the retinal blood vessels are extremely thin or even invisible. Over time, the depression is filled with fibrous tissue, and vision is severely damaged or completely lost."}
{"title":"Section 3 Intraocular foreign body","text":"Penetrating trauma can bring foreign bodies into the eye. There are many types of intraocular foreign bodies, including metallic, non-metallic, and vegetable. The volume can be as small as the patient does not know it, or as large as 2 cm. Fundus examination can often reveal the location of foreign bodies and the penetrating channels, often accompanied by inflammation and bleeding. If a tear occurs at the puncture site or foreign body, it can also cause rhegmatogenous retinal detachment and traction retinal detachment caused by advanced hemorrhagic fibrosis. Iron foreign bodies are not removed in time for a long time, and ironosis can occur. If the retina is involved, nerve cells and pigment epithelial cells can degenerate and atrophy. Copper foreign bodies can cause copeniosis, which is more intense than the inflammatory response caused by iron foreign bodies. Iron and copper foreign bodies can cause fundus proliferative vitreoretinopathy. The degree of vision damage varies greatly depending on whether the site of the injury affects the macula, its severity, and whether there are complications."}
{"title":"Section 4 Damage to the retina caused by various lights","text":"Previously, it was understood that light damage to the retina was limited to retinal burns caused by solar eclipses. Due to known protection methods, they are rarely seen. In addition, there is maculopathy caused by arc light. In recent years, reports that ophthalmic examination instruments such as ophthalmoscope and microscope illumination light may also cause eye damage have aroused people's interest again. Laser is widely used in clinical practice, and severe macular damage caused by laser can occasionally be seen. Light causes damage to the retina through three basic mechanisms, namely photochemistry, photocoagulation and mechanical. In the visible light range, especially blue light, photochemical reactions can occur without causing tissue heating. When light production exceeds body temperature by 10F, photocoagulation occurs, causing the protein in retinal tissue to coagulate. Mechanical light damage is caused by the rapid absorption of light by tissue to produce sound waves or the formation of gas."}
{"title":"Section 4 Damage to the retina caused by various lights  1. Light damage to the retina caused by eye inspection instruments","text":"Eye examination instruments such as the light source of ophthalmoscope have no evidence of light damage to the retina under the brightness and time conditions used for routine examinations. When performing cataract extraction, the light source of the surgical microscope, especially the lack of the protective effect of the lens itself, can cause light damage. Fundus examination showed an ovoid grayish-white edema lesion in the macula area, and the size of the lesion was consistent with the focus size of the light spot. The edema was then gradually absorbed, leaving behind a slight pigment disorder. The damage caused by this light source is characterized by both thermal and photochemical damage. Vision may be slightly affected."}
{"title":"Section 4 Damage to the retina caused by various lights  2. Laser-induced retinal light damage","text":"Laser light damage to the retina can accidentally occur while developing and debugging lasers, or occasionally passing through the laser laboratory. Fundus examination often has a grayish-white roughly circular edema area in the central area of the macula, about 1PD, often complicated with hemorrhage. In recent years, the author has seen 1 case. When the solid laser is emitted at 1.06\u03bcm, the laser is reflected by the reflector into the eye, causing light damage. Vision dropped from 1.5 to 0.2. OCT examination showed that there was a dense reflective mass in the center of the macula that slightly protruded into the vitreous body and blocked the light reflection of the tissue behind it. Subsequently, the edema and bleeding gradually absorbed, often leaving behind a fibrotic scar. Permanent vision damage, often around 0.1. Laser light damage is mainly prevention and can be protected."}
{"title":"Section 4 Damage to the retina caused by various lights  3. Solar retinal damage","text":"Solar retinal damage is not limited to viewing solar eclipses (which are rare now). Light reflected by sunlight from water, mirror surfaces, snow, etc. enters the eye, and can cause the same eye disease. Watching electric arc light can also cause illness. Fundus examination showed a yellow-white punctate lesion in the fovea, surrounded by a very pale gray area. A few days later, the spot disappeared and was replaced by a red spot in the center and a pigmented halo around it. After about 2 weeks, a small red, well-bordered but irregular lamellar macular hole may appear. This hole can exist for a long time."}
{"title":"Section 4 Damage to the retina caused by various lights  3. Solar retinal damage","text":"It was previously believed that the disease was the result of the thermal effect of light. In recent years, experiments have proved that this is the result of photochemical reactions. Blue light is the main light wave. It causes photochemical reactions to produce reactive oxygen species and free radicals, which causes damage to the visual cells, RPE cells and membranes, causing changes in their shape and function. Of course, some reactions are reversible. Patients eventually gain better vision. If light damage is repeated, the macula may leave behind pigment disorder. Vision can be reduced to around 0.1."}
{"title":"Section 4 Damage to the retina caused by various lights  4. Ionic radiation induced retinal optic nerve damage","text":"Ionic radiation includes X-rays, gamma rays, beta rays, etc. X-ray treatment of orbital tumors has a long history, so people are familiar with the damage caused by X-ray to the eye. In recent years, local ophthalmic application radiotherapy has been carried out. The most commonly used nuclides are iodine-125 (gamma ray) and ruthenium-106 (beta ray).

Ionic radiation induced retinal optic nerve damage","text":"After X-ray irradiation, the vascular structure and leakage of the retina and optic nerve are mainly changed. The consequences will take months and years to emerge. The fundus changes are exactly the same as diabetic retinopathy. Restricted anterior arteriole stenosis, silk cotton spots, microaneurysms, capillary bed dilatation, perivascular sheath, capillary non-perfusion areas, retinal exudation and hemorrhage can be seen in the posterior pole, especially in the macula area. Macular CME, perimacular non-perfused areas, and exudative maculopathy are the main causes of vision decline. In the late stage, disc neovascularization, vitreous hemorrhage, proliferative vitreoretinopathy, and traction retinal detachment can occur. The optic nerve can undergo severe atrophy. The principles of treatment are the same as those for the treatment of diabetic retinopathy. This disease is one of the major eye diseases that cause vision loss after radiotherapy."}
{"title":"Section 1 Retinal hemangioma","text":"Retinal hemangioma in a broad sense includes three types: retinal capillary hemangioma, retinal cavernous hemangioma and retinal racemose hemangioma. Clinically, since retinal capillary hemangioma is the most common, the general expression of retinal hemangioma actually refers to the retinal capillary hemangioma. Capillary hemangioma of the retina can occur in the myopic disc (described in another chapter) or in other locations outside the optic disc. This hemangioma can be an isolated condition called Von-Hippel, or it can be part of the Von-Hippel-Lindau(VHL) syndrome. The latter is an autosomal dominant inherited disease often accompanied by hemangioblastoma in the cerebellum and other abnormalities in visceral tissue."}
{"title":"Section 1 Retinal hemangioma","text":"Hemangioma that occurs in the early stage can be as small as fundus microangioma, with no exudation or obvious nutrient vessels around the tumor. The diagnosis at this time is mainly based on medical history and family history. Over time, small tumors gradually grow, transitioning from flat shapes in the retinal layer to tumors protruding into the vitreous cavity, accompanied by maturation of nutrient vessels. When it develops into a typical hemangioma, it appears as a red or orange-red spherical mass with obviously tortuous and expanded nutrient vessels communicating with it. Different degrees of exudation began to appear around the tumor, and in severe cases, exudative retinal detachment developed. VHL patients have a higher incidence in both eyes, multiple lesions can develop in each eye, and newly formed hemangioma can be seen during subsequent follow-up."}
{"title":"Section 1 Retinal hemangioma","text":"Orange-red tumor, tortuous and expanded nutrient vessels, and the consistency between tumor size and nutrient vessel dilation are the core characteristics for the diagnosis of this disease. If the orange-red tumor is obvious but the slender nourishing blood vessels are inconsistent with it, retinal vascular proliferative tumors should be considered, which occur more frequently in middle-aged and elderly people."}
{"title":"Section 1 Retinal hemangioma","text":"FFA shows that the tumor fills rapidly during the arterial phase and gradually leaks fluorescence. When the imaging observation time is long enough, the \"flushing\" phenomenon of the tumor can also be seen in the late stage. The nutrient vessels of the tumor are particularly clearly displayed on the imaging film. A tumor may have varying numbers of nutrient vessel connections. Multiple small hemangioma and surrounding telangiectasia, microhemangioma and non-perfused areas can also be seen around large hemangioma."}
{"title":"Section 2 retinal cavernous hemangioma","text":"Retinal cavernous hemangioma is a very rare fundus disease. Like other retinal hemangioma, this disease can also be accompanied by abnormal vascular development in other tissues and organs, mainly involving the skin and central nervous system. Unlike other retinal hemangioma, it rarely causes complications such as bleeding and exudation."}
{"title":"Section 2 retinal cavernous hemangioma","text":"The fundus changes of this disease are very characteristic and are difficult to be confused with other fundus diseases. The tumor body of hemangioma has a purple-red grape string-like appearance, and there are often some fibroplastic membranes on the surface. The characteristics of FFA are that the filling of the tumor is extremely slow. Because the separation of a sphere of blood in the tumor can lead to \"cap-like fluorescence\" signs during imaging, fluorescein does not seep out of the tumor in the late stage of imaging."}
{"title":"Section 3 Retinal racemose hemangioma","text":"Retinal racemose hemangioma is essentially a congenital abnormal communication between retinal arteries and veins. It varies widely in scope, and may involve only a small piece of the retina, or it may cover the entire retina, or even other parts of the optical pathway such as the optic nerve, optic chiasm, optic tract, and even the occipital cortex. Some patients also have abnormalities in orbital vascular tissue development. A person with racemose vascular abnormalities in the retina combined with vascular malformations in the midbrain is generally called Wybur-Mason syndrome."}
{"title":"Section 3 Retinal racemose hemangioma","text":"Abnormal communication between arteries and veins can cause the communicating blood vessels to be abnormally tortuous and expand into a ridge-like shape. The same diameter thickening and metabolism without tissue make the blood color in the arteries and veins similar. The combined effect of the two makes the diseased retinal arteries and veins difficult to distinguish. Long-term exposure to high perfusion pressure can cause degeneration of the vessel wall, destruction of the blood-retinal barrier, and manifestations of hemorrhage and exudation in the fundus, which affects the patient's vision. Of course, the patient's vision impairment can also be caused by abnormal vascular lesions in other parts of the visual path, and some neurological symptoms can often occur."}

In fact, the disease is more common than reported. The disease can occur on the optic disc or any other part of the fundus. This tumor is common on the optic disc and adjacent retina. Often one eye. Most common among young people. There are also people older than 60 years old. They often seek medical treatment due to blurred vision and distorted vision. The hamartoma on the optic disc appears as a slight bulge with unclear boundaries. The tumor consists of many fine twisted capillaries, and the surface often has a translucent fibrous membrane. Retinal pigment epithelial cells proliferate in the tumor. Hyperplastic membranes of tumors can cause traction retinal folds and exudation within and from the retina. Complications included choroidal neovascular membrane, retinal hemorrhage, and vitreous hemorrhage."}
{"title":"Section 5 Retinoblastoma","text":"Retinoblastoma (RB) is the most common intra-ocular malignant tumor in infants and young children. It occurs between the ages of 2 and 5.

{"title":"Section 5 Retinoblastoma","text":"There are no obvious symptoms in the early stage. When the tumor grows to a certain extent, yellow light reflection occurs in the pupil area, which is characterized by white pupils. In the late stage, secondary glaucoma can occur, retrobulbar spread or optic nerve invasion can lead to exophthalmos, and the tumor grows forward and spreads outside the bulb to protrude outside the orbit. The tumor itself may have varying degrees of blood vessel formation. The dilated blood vessels of the retina on the surface of the tumor can grow into the interior of the tumor. Large RBs are often accompanied by small RBs implanted in the vitreous body. Intravitreal RB can sink to the lower part of the anterior chamber presenting pseudo-hypopyema. The RPE and choroidal capillary layers at the tumor may atrophy. The blood vessels of the choroid and retina can also be anastomosed. Tumors smaller than 4PD are located behind the equator, so alternative therapy may be considered. The author used TTT to treat several cases of small RB(around 2PD) located at the posterior pole. RB showed a flat scar after treatment. No recurrence was observed for 3 years."}
{"title":"Section 5 Retinoblastoma","text":"Retinoblastoma (Rb), commonly known as \"eye cancer\", is the most common intraocular malignant tumor in infants and young children. 84% occur within 3 years of age.

{"title":"Section 5 Retinoblastoma","text":"Based on the clinical manifestations, combined with necessary examinations, a clinical diagnosis can be made. Among these clinical examinations, the most important one is fundus examination, especially indirect fundus examination under anesthesia (EUA) after mydriasis. This is the key to diagnosis and staging, and determines the next treatment plan and prognosis. Other examinations include B-ultrasound or color ultrasound, which can detect solid lesions and sound shadows in the eyeball, and distinguish intraocular lesions such as Coats 'disease, ROP, and PHPV;CT examination can detect calcified lesions in the eyeball and is also an important basis for clinical diagnosis (more than 90% of advanced retinoblastomas will be accompanied by calcification);MRI can detect whether the tumor has broken through the eyeball and invaded tissues such as the optic nerve and intracranial, and whether there are third-lateral tumors in the intracranial (patients with bilateral tumors also have primary lesions such as the intracranial pineal body). Lumbar puncture can detect whether there are tumor cells in cerebrospinal fluid, and bone puncture can detect bone metastases of tumors. These are mainly used in patients suspected of having metastasized throughout the body."}
{"title":"Section 5 Retinoblastoma","text":"Combined with the above examination results, retinoblastoma can be simply divided into intraocular stage, extraocular stage and systemic metastasis stage.

It is a group of diseases caused by congenital vascular dysplasia. Hemangioma can be divided into retina and optic disc according to the growth site, and the two can merge or exist separately. According to the growth mode, it can be divided into endogenous (originating from the surface of the retina and growing into the vitreous) and exogenous (originating from the outer layer of the retina, mostly around the optic disc). If the central nervous system and other organs are affected, it is called a disease."}
{"title":"Section 6 Optic disc hemangioma","text":"Endogenous hemangioma of the optic disc has a dark red hemispherical bulge with a capsule and clear boundaries. Depending on the size of the tumor, it can partially or completely block the optic disc, causing optic disc edema and vessel tortuosity, and ring-like lipid exudation and detachment around the optic disc. This type of tumor has no characteristics of arterial feeding vessels and venous return vessels. Endogenous hemangioma located in the periphery has this feature."}
{"title":"Section 6 Optic disc hemangioma","text":"Exogenous hemangioma around the optic disc is often orange-red, with unclear boundaries, and has no capsule. It is easily misdiagnosed as new blood vessels around the optic disc or optic disc edema. FFA examination is helpful in differentiation."}
{"title":"Section 7 Optic disc melanocytoma","text":"The disease is a congenital disease and has been suffering from it at birth. It has nothing to do with gender or eye difference, and it is a benign tumor. It is often discovered during fundus examination. A dark black mass of varying sizes can be seen on the optic disc. When it is small, it only covers a very small part of the optic disc. Large masses can bulge very high and even block the movement of blood vessels. There may be organized objects on the surface of the tumor. Under pressure from the mass, the optic disc is sometimes edema. Generally, it does not affect vision in the early stage. For example, compression of the optic disc can cause vision loss or visual field loss. Such tumors can also be seen on the retina outside the optic disc. Attention should be paid to the differentiation of this disease from choroidal melanoma. The former is benign and does not need to be treated; the latter has a brown bulge and grows rapidly and requires treatment. Those who mistakenly removed their eyes due to insufficient understanding of the disease in the past."}

It has melanin, which appears dark brown, generally has clear boundaries, no obvious protuberances, generally less than 1PD, is oval or round, is located at the posterior pole, and does not cause retinal detachment. Generally speaking, pigmented nevus are in the volume. There is no change in size. Some pigmented nevi, after many years, can cause degeneration of the vitreous membrane (Bruch membrane)(Drusen), serous retinal detachment, and even choroidal neovascularization. Especially if the nevi body is larger than IPD, attention needs to be paid to it and choroidal melanoma."}
{"title":"Section 9 Choroidal hemangioma","text":"Choroidal hemangioma is a developmental abnormality. It has two manifestations: isolated and diffuse. The former generally occurs in people without systemic disease, while the latter is usually accompanied by hemangioma of the brain and face, called Sturge-Weber syndrome. A typical isolated hemangioma is located at the posterior pole of the fundus, with an orange-red hemispherical bulge. It often causes clinical symptoms because it destroys the pigment epithelium structure on the surface and secondary fluid leakage. In severe cases, exudative retinal detachment is secondary. Because choroidal hemangioma is a benign disease, during the long-term course of disease, the pigment epithelium on the surface of the tumor may not only show abnormal barrier destruction, but also have pigment proliferation and migration, and the neuroepithelium of the retina may also show cystic degeneration. Tissue degeneration and pigment changes on the surface of these tumors can change their color. At this time, it is easy to consider other types of tumors. FFA examination and ocular ultrasound examination can be differentiated. B-mode ultrasound showed that the tumor was fusiform or hemispherical, with relatively uniform and moderate internal echoes, and no signs such as choroidal fovea and sound attenuation. FFA showed that the tumor showed abnormal vessel-like structures in the early stage of imaging and rapidly enhanced and leaked. Indocyanine green chorography is more helpful in the diagnosis of choroidal hemangioma. In ICGA imaging, the blood vessels of hemangioma are visualized in the early stages and become clearer over time, and gradually fade in the late stages. Diffuse choroidal hemangioma in Sturge-Weber syndrome appears in the fundus as an orange-red thickening of the entire fundus with no obvious boundaries, and sometimes only feels after being compared with the contralateral eye. Patients often suffer from retinal detachment and glaucoma."}
{"title":"Section 10 Choroidal melanoma","text":"Choroidal melanoma is more common in middle-aged and elderly people. The fundus manifestations are more common in the posterior pole, showing a round isolated solid protuberance that is grayish brown, brown, or even brownish black.

Hemorrhage, orange pigment, capillaries and yellow-white exudate can be seen on the surface of the tumor. The retina has secondary edema, cystic changes, pigment changes, etc. There is often hemorrhage surrounding the tumor and even reaching into the vitreous body. Shallow retinal detachment is often present on the surface of the tumor. Higher retinal detachment may also be combined in the lower fundus."}

Most of the lesions are located in the peridisc area. In severe cases, they can encircle the optic disc in a circle. In a few cases, they can invade the macula area first. When the tumor involves the macula area, the patient's vision will decrease. The tumor is yellow-white and flat, with uneven surface and edges protruding like pseudopods. In areas where the retinal pigment epithelium is significantly atrophied, the color of the tumor is whiter, and the choroidal vascular plexus in the tumor is easy to see."}
{"title":"Section 11 Choroidal osteoma","text":"Ultrasound or CT examination can help confirm the diagnosis. A-ultrasound showed high reflectance peaks from the internal interface of the tumor, which remained after reducing sensitivity so that reflections from the retroorbital soft tissue were subtracted. B-ultrasound also showed high-reflexes and slightly raised plaque-like lesions, and the acoustic shadow still existed after other ocular tissue structures and orbital components had subsided. CT scan showed radiopaque plaques at the choroid level with bone density. FFA has certain characteristics. The tumor shows patchy and highly fluorescent in the early stage of imaging and diffusely stained in the late stage. The choroidal vascular plexus on the inner surface of the tumor fills at the early stage and gradually regrows at the later stage."}

{"title":"Section 12 Metastatic carcinoma of the choroid","text":"Due to its abundant blood vessels, the choroid is often the site of metastasis of primary tumors in other parts of the body. The primary cancer in male patients is often in the lungs, and the primary cancer in female patients is often in the breast and lungs. Fundus examination showed that metastatic tumors often appear as yellow-white or gray-white flat protuberances, generally less than 3mm, and are often located at the posterior pole. Due to different times and different metastasis sites, the metastatic tumors may be located near or around the optic disc, or around the macula, near the great vascular arch. They appear diffuse or isolated growth, can be seen in one eye or both eyes, and can be single or multiple. The author once saw 7 metastases in one eye.

When tumors are small, they generally have no symptoms and are difficult to detect by routine eye examination. When the tumor grows, it may be blocked by black shadows in front of your eyes. The sclera is congested and blood vessels are dilated in the corresponding area of ciliary melanoma, and some thick and tortuous blood vessels can be seen; the tumor invades the anterior chamber angle, which can cause secondary glaucoma; pushing the iris, the iris in the area where the tumor is located is bulged and the anterior chamber becomes shallow; When the anterior chamber angle and iris are involved, a black mass can be seen; the tumor compresses the lens, which can cause changes in refractive state.

Tumor necrosis, pigment detachment and deposition may occur in the anterior chamber, hyphema, vitreous opacity, vitreous hemorrhage, exudative retinal detachment, etc. A few ciliary melanomas show diffuse growth and involve the entire ciliary body. This type develops retinal detachment and extraocular spread early, and has a poor prognosis. Most cases presented with localized distension of the iris tissue near the periphery and shallow angle of the chamber; brown-black or gray-yellow hemispherical mass behind the iris or behind the lens; localized opacity of the lens or localized indentation at the equatorial part, complete opacity, as well as exudative retinal detachment and high intraocular pressure."}

{"title":"Section 13: Ciliary body melanoma","text":"In addition to routine examination methods, ultrasound biomicroscopy (UBM) is of great value in the early diagnosis of ciliary body and iris tumors. UBM is a new imaging examination method that uses ultra-high frequency (50 - 100MHz) ultrasound to perform microscopic examination of the tissue structure of the anterior segment. It is characterized by clear imaging and high resolution. It can clearly display the cornea, anterior chamber, angle, lens, ciliary body and other tissue structures. In particular, it can clearly display the structure of the posterior chamber, making up for the previous shortcoming that the posterior chamber could not be examined in detail on living tissues. It has its own unique diagnosis of anterior segment tumors. UBM can measure the thickness of the lesion, determine the scope of the tumor, and observe changes in the size of the lesion to provide quantitative basis for follow-up. UBM can clearly show early ciliary body tumors before routine examination methods fail to show them. It is also of great value in the differential diagnosis of anterior segment tumors and is the best method to distinguish iris tumors from primary ciliary body tumors involving the iris of the anterior chamber angle. Therefore, UBM has become an important means for clinical diagnosis, differential diagnosis, treatment selection, and follow-up of ciliary body tumors."}

These small branches diverge in a \"Y\" shape and fill the entire vitreous cavity. When they reach the back of the lens, they branch off to form a capillary network at the back of the lens. When the embryo is 10mm, many branches originate from the vascular network behind the lens around the equator of the lens, forming a vascular network on the lateral side of the lens. When the embryo develops to 17mm, the lateral blood vessels branch to the anterior surface of the lens to form a vascular network in the anterior part of the lens. When the fetus develops to 40 - 50mm, the hyaline artery develops to its peak and anastomoses with the lens vessels. When the fetus develops to 60mm, the vitreous blood vessels begin to atrophy, initially occurring in small branches in the periphery. They lose contact with each other and then lose contact with the main blood vessels. The distal end forms a spiral filament that hangs on the posterior surface of the lens. When the fetus is 8 months old, the main arterial trunk of the vitreous body loses contact with the optic disc, and finally all the blood vessels atrophy.

The diameter of each blood vessel is not much different, and arteries and veins cannot be distinguished. The temporal retinal blood vessels develop longer, about 4DD, and the nasal blood vessels develop slightly shorter. The progressive edge of the blood vessel is a conical, cylindrical or coronal free end. These free ends are solid endothelial cell cords filled with eosinophil-like material and sometimes with blood cell components. The free margin of the coronary shape has differentiated to form a capillary network. When the fetus is 5 months old, the nasal vessels of the retina develop rapidly and are almost flush with the supratemporal and infratemporal vascular networks. At this time, the large blood vessels began to differentiate. With the stimulation of blood flow, the partial pressure of oxygen in the blood vessels increased, the capillaries around the blood vessels shrank, and non-perfusion areas appeared. These blood vessels later developed into arteries. At this time, an irregular capillary network forms between the large blood vessels. When blood enters the capillary network, the pressure decreases, the flow rate slows down, and when it enters the large blood vessel on the other side, the flow rate is even slower. These blood vessels experience low pressure, increase the lumen, thin the wall, and later develop into veins. By the time the fetus develops to 6 months, it can clearly distinguish between arteries and veins. The characteristics of the artery are that there are many cell components on the wall. In addition to the cells arranged vertically, there are also cells arranged in a circle, and the cells are deeply stained. The non-capillary area adjacent to the blood vessel widened. There are few cellular components in the venous wall and light cell staining. The capillary network between the arteries and veins has increased, but the mesh is still irregular. At this time, the anterior arterioles and posterior venules also began to form. The anterior arteriole has cells gathered and closely arranged at the point where it originates from the artery, with large cell nuclei and deep staining. The anterior arteriole runs longer and branches farther away from the main artery to form a capillary network. The posterior venule has a short course and has no special structure at the entry point. When the fetus develops to 7 months, the diameter of the retinal arteries and veins increases and runs beyond the equator, but have not yet reached the serrated margin. When the fetus is 8 to 9 months old, the retina develops rapidly and extends to the near serrate margin. The retinal blood vessels of the full-term fetus have reached the serrated margin."}

The capillary walls gradually become regular. Endothelial cells are arranged on the inner wall of blood vessels, while pericytes are outside, and the number is increased and they are arranged in a single layer. During this period, capillaries were formed, assembled and rebuilt. Between the great vessels and beside the great arteries, the increase in oxygen partial pressure caused the capillaries to first lose perfusion, the lumen was occluded, the nuclei of the vessel wall cells were dissolved, leaving behind cords without cellular components., and a non-perfusion area around the artery was formed. When the fetus reaches 7 months, the density of the capillary network increases significantly, and two layers of capillary networks form at the equator. When the fetus develops to 8 to 9 months, the retinal capillaries develop rapidly, and radial capillaries form around the optic papilla, so the capillary network at the posterior pole of the retina can be as many as 3 layers. Basically reach the serrated edge. However, the capillary network in the periphery is sparse, with only one layer of vascular network, and the arterioles and venules are directly anastomosed to form a vascular arch. After birth, the retinal capillaries are fully developed and are located between the great arteries and veins."}

Formation and differentiation of retinal blood vessels","text":"The capillaries in the macula area are supplied by small arterial branches from the superior and inferior temporal branches. There are two different views of the central capillary-free zone (CFZ) during embryonic development. One view is that no blood vessels develop throughout the center of the macula. Another view is that there are capillaries in the center of the macula in the early stage of the fetus. As the fetus develops, the capillaries in the macula continue to develop, atrophy, combine and rebuild, and finally form a capillary-free area in the center of the macula. Some authors used a digestive patch to observe the development of retinal blood vessels in 27 eyes of immature infants. They found that there was a capillary network in the center of the macula before 25 weeks of the fetus. After 25 weeks, small and incomplete capillary-free areas began to appear. With the development of the fovea, the capillaries atrophied to form cords, and finally disappeared. The central capillary-free area gradually expanded, reaching 500um at birth. We also observed digestive patches of 65 fetuses and neonatal cadavers. We also found that there were blood vessels in the center of the macula in the early stage of the fetus. As the fetus developed, the capillaries in the macula area atrophied and formed cords, and finally regrouped to form a single layer of the macula area.

Formation and differentiation of retinal blood vessels","text":"In the early stages of fetal development, that is, 4 months old, the retinal cord structure can be found. Kuwabara is called the intercapillarybridge or strand. This is the result of the atrophy and reconstruction of the capillary network during development. When the fetus is 6 months old, the number of cord structures in the vascular network is the largest, especially in the capillary network between the great vessels and beside the arteries. Eosinophilic stained thick cords can be seen. When the fetus develops to 8 to 9 months, this cord structure can still be seen in the vascular network in the macula area and surrounding areas. After birth, this cord structure disappears or occurs occasionally. Ashton et al. once described the process of cord formation. During the development of retinal blood vessels, capillaries with increased oxygen partial pressure first lose perfusion, the lumen is occluded, and the cell nuclei in the vessel wall are dissolved, fragmented, and finally absorbed, leaving behind a cord without cellular components. It is also believed that during capillary remodeling, cells in the blood vessel wall slide to both sides along the basement membrane and retreat towards the adjacent large blood vessel, causing this capillary to lose its cellular components and form a cord. Therefore, the cord structure is a product of the development and reconstruction of capillaries, and the formation of non-capillary areas around the large blood vessels is also the result of capillary reconstruction and shrinkage with the increase of oxygen partial pressure."}

When the fetus develops to 5 to 6 months, these cells increase, and primitive endothelial cell cords appear among these cells. When capillaries form and pericytes appear, undifferentiated mesenchymal cells disappear. Therefore, this type of cell may be embryonic mesenchymal cells with the ability to differentiate in multiple directions.

At the fourth week of the fetus, mesodermal tissue develops into the choroidal capillary plexus on the outer surface of the optic vesicle adjacent to the retinal pigment epithelium. At first, the choroidal capillary lumen is small, like a slit. Endothelial cells are very thick. When the fetus is 2 months old, the choroidal capillaries are basically developed, the capillaries are dense, the blood vessel lumen is enlarged, and micropores appear in the blood vessel wall and gradually increase.

To understand the detailed structure of blood vessels, other ex vivo observations such as light microscope observation of ocular tissue slices, digestive paving, blood vessel ink perfusion, and transmission electron microscopy are required. The above examinations can only see the two-dimensional structure of blood vessels. In 1971, Murakami successfully observed the capillaries of the liver and kidney using resin perfusion combined with scanning electron microscopy. This is a major breakthrough in the study of blood vessel structure. Using this method, the three-dimensional structure of the course and distribution of blood vessels can be clearly seen, and the fine structure on the surface of blood vessels can be seen. In 1973, Matsuo used resin perfusion to study the blood vessels of the ciliary bodies of domestic cats and guinea pigs. In 1974, Shimizu and Ujiie used resin erosion casts to systematically observe the vascular structure of the retina, choroid and other ocular tissues of the monkey eye. As a result, this method is widely used in Japan to study the blood vessel structure of various organs and tissues. From 1984 to 1988, we conducted a series of studies on vascular resin casts in human and animal eyes. A total of 148 eyes of human, monkey, cat, rabbit and mouse were observed.

Almost no person has the same course of the branches of the central retinal artery, and even the same person's eyes have different blood vessel distribution. The central retinal artery enters the optic disc and then enters the eye at the center of the optic disc.

The long-chain type is the most common, characterized by a long chain shape that runs long and straight, and rarely matches. They originate from the central retinal artery and its branches and encircle the optic disc, run along the main artery and vein, or cross the major arteries and veins, and run radially parallel to each other. The path of RPCs running along the supratemporal and infratemporal is long, up to 6 - 7mm, and the path of RPCs running along the superior and infranasal vessels is short, about 4 - 5 mm. The RPCs run very short in the antetemporal and antenasal directions, and they are not distributed to the macula area. After being emitted from the artery around the optic papilla, long chains of RPCs run radially parallel to each other. The average distance between the two RPCs is about 40um. It often branches during walking. When walking for 50 to 200um, branches will be issued, forming a Y-shaped or T-shaped connection with the main branch, and then continues to walk forward. Sometimes there is horizontal communication between two parallel RPCs, forming an H-shaped connection, so the capillary mesh is rectangular or rectangular. RPCs do not travel in a straight line but are slightly undulating and travel tortuously in the nerve fiber layer. During the journey, some RPCs connect with the capillary plexus below them, and some form a circular termination point and enter the collecting venule.

At a distance of 2.5 - 3mm from the temporal side of the optic disc, 2 - 3 small arteries originate from the superior and inferior temporal branch arteries respectively, running from above and below to the macula area, arranged radially. The diameter of the nearby macula area decreases to about 25um, and a double capillary network is formed at a distance of 180 - 380um from the boundary of the non-vascular area. When these vascular networks are close to the fovea of the macula, they connect to each other to form a complete single-layer vascular arch ring, leaving a non-vascular area with a central diameter of 450 to 500um. Sometimes a small artery extends from the temporal side of the optic disc to the macula, participating in the formation of the macula vascular ring and supplying the nasal side of the macula. The capillaries gather into the venous capillary network, which is slightly deeper and slightly posterior than arterial ones and slightly beyond the center of the macula.

{"title":"Section 1 Retinal vascular structure  3. There are no capillary zones around the arteries","text":"Non-capillary zones around the retinal arteries are present in the eyes of mammals with well-developed retinal capillaries, such as humans, monkeys, dogs, cats, pigs and mice. Humans and monkeys are rich in capillaries, and the non-capillary area around the arteries is clearer than in cats and dogs. Its distribution starts from the four main branches of the central retinal artery at the posterior pole, and non-capillary zones can be seen around the macula area and peripheral arteriole branches. The width of the avascular zone of the human eye is. Observed from the resin cast specimen, the arterioles do not branch immediately after they originate from the parent artery, but instead branch after a long distance to form a capillary network. These vascular networks do not branch back across the artery, so a capillary-free area is formed around the artery. Due to the multilayer capillary network at the posterior pole, when the specimen is viewed from the front to the back, it can be seen that the non-capillary areas are located on both sides of the artery, and the deep capillary network is located behind the artery. When the retinal vessel cast specimen is cut open and viewed from the side of the incised edge, the artery is located in the center, and the non-capillary area surrounds the artery, like a tube with an axis. The non-capillary area around the veins is not obvious or very narrow because there are many branches of the veins. When small veins gather to form a large vein, one can enter the vein, or two to three small veins can merge into one large vein at the same time at the same place. The confluence is very close to the great vein, and the capillary network is also close to the vein, and even runs around the vein. Moreover, the number of collected venules is more than that of the anterior capillary arterioles, so there are no obvious non-capillary zones around the vein. However, when the great vein is accompanied by the great artery, a narrow non-capillary zone can also be seen beside the great vein. Why are there capillary zones around the arteries? This is related to the development and reconstruction of retinal blood vessels. In the early stages, when the retinal arteries and veins have not yet been fully differentiated, non-capillary zones do not exist and begin to appear at six months of gestation. Due to the increase in partial pressure of oxygen around the artery, the nuclei of the capillary wall around the artery atrophied and dissolved, blood flow disappeared, and the blood vessels were atresized, leaving behind cords with no cellular structure. These cords gradually disappear during vascular development, forming a non-capillary zone around the artery. The blood flow of the capillaries around the veins is slow, the oxygen supply is insufficient, and the capillaries are increased and dense during development, so the absence of capillary bands around the veins is not obvious. Due to the presence or absence of capillary space around the blood vessels, edema, exudation, inflammatory cells, etc. caused by any disease easily surround the blood vessels. The adventitia of the artery is rich in collagen, which is more easily damaged and dissolved, damaging the blood vessel wall."}

Henkind et al. pointed out when studying digestive patches in various animals that this circular structure exists at the branches of the anterior arterioles of cats, dogs, mice, pigs and some monkeys. It consists of many cells with deep nuclear staining, and may be related to the regulation of blood flow by retinal circulation. In resin-infused specimens from humans, monkeys, cats and mice, we found a circular structure at the branches of the arterioles and the anterior capillary arterioles. The maternal artery is oval and concave, and the cellular composition at the branches is increased. Endothelial cell nuclear impression can be seen. At the same time, the diameter of the tube often narrows and then returns to normal size.

Nuclear impressions can be seen on the surface of large and small blood vessels, arranged parallel to the long axis of the blood vessel. Depending on the size of the blood vessel, the nuclear impressions can range from 1 or 2 to 6 or 7 rows, and the longitudinal distance between each nuclear impression is 15 to 30um. The nuclear footprint of arteries and veins is different. The footprint on the surface of the artery is long and elliptical, with a longer vertical diameter of about 15 - 20um and a shorter transverse diameter of about 5\u03bcm.

There are few nuclear impressions on the surface of the vein, oval or round, and the vertical diameter is shorter than that of the artery, about 5\u03bcm. Therefore, arteries and veins can be distinguished according to the shape of nuclear impressions on the surface of blood vessels. The nuclear footprint on the surface of capillaries is sparse and the diameter becomes smaller. It is oval at high magnification.

They form the nasal and lateral branches at 3 o'clock and 9 o'clock on both sides of the optic nerve. They continue to advance in the posterior sclera obliquely penetrating into the human eye. Some branches near the equator supply the nasal, temporal and anterior choroidal sectors."}

The diameter, length and number of arterioles and venules vary from region to region. The anterior arteriole at the posterior pole is thick, with many branches and short course. It runs between the macrovascular layer and the capillary layer, issuing branches to supply the choroid lobule. When entering the arterial lobule, it runs vertically, and when it moves from the equator to the periphery, the number decreases, and the diameter becomes thinner and it runs long. The anterior arteriole often shows stenosis at the point where it originates from the maternal artery. The posterior venules are longer than the anterior arterioles at the posterior pole, and the number increases from the equator to the periphery. The diameter becomes thicker, up to 89um. There is no narrowing where they merge into the venules. Usually 3 - 4 posterior venules merge into the larger veins at the same time."}

{"title":"Section 2 Choroidal vessel  1. Distribution characteristics of choroidal vessels","text":"1. Posterior polar choroidal capillaries The posterior polar capillaries have a large diameter, high density, and tortuous and continuous movement. The arterial leaflets and venous leaflets are densely embedded, the boundaries are unclear, and it is not easy to see the anterior capillary arterioles that supply them and the posterior capillary venules that drain them. Viewed from the front, the leaflets are quadrangular or pentagonal, and the center is often slit-shaped. The capillaries of the arterial leaflets are small in diameter and are arranged like petals. The venous leaflets are thicker in diameter and have many folds on the surface. Viewed from the sclera, the lobule is supplied by multiple arterioles. The capillaries that make up the lobules are very large in diameter. We measured 100 choroidal capillaries at the posterior pole of the human eye, with a minimum diameter of 16.3 um and a maximum diameter of 36um, with an average of 25.19 um \u00b1 0.99 um. Other authors observed the choroidal capillaries in monkeys and found that the diameters of various parts were different. The diameter was 12.8 \u00b1 2.0 um around the optic papilla, 11.4 um and 1.5 um in the macula area, and 9.2 \u00b1 1.1 um between the equatorial and posterior pole. Regarding the distribution of arterial leaflets and venous leaflets, some people think that the venous leaflets are the center and the arterial leaflets are located around them. Since the arterioles and venules are inlaid with each other, it can also be considered that the arterial leaflets are the center and the venous leaflets surround them. The distribution of leaflets is dense at the posterior pole, and the veins are slightly smaller. As we move towards the equator and periphery, the number of venous leaflets gradually increases, and almost all the near-serrated margins are sparse venous meshes. Shimizu et al. reported that there are more veins in the periphery than arteries, and the ratio of veins to arteries is about 10:1."}

Therefore, the choroid around the optic papilla has abundant blood supply and many branches. They travel centripetal around the optic papilla to the edge of the optic papilla and terminate, forming an incomplete arterial ring that runs in a curved curve. Viewed from the retina, these arterial rings are not continuous with each other to form a complete ring, but form multiple incomplete rings. These rings have different lengths, and some multiple capillaries as long as 1850um can enter the same ring. Or enter the same arterial ring from branches of several anterior arterioles. In a sense, there is an anastomosis between the choroidal capillaries surrounding the optic disc, so the posterior pole choroidal vessel occlusion is less severe than the retinal vascular system."}

Some people think that there is a special macula artery supply here, but most scholars believe that there is no special macula artery supply, only rich blood supply is the characteristic. The submacula choroidal capillaries are thick and have a diameter of up to 34um. The number of arterioles supplying the lobule is high, and the number of posterior venules draining the lobule is high. The inferior macular artery lobule may be supplied by two or more anterior arterioles, while the rest may be supplied by one anterior arteriole. Moreover, the anterior arteriole under the macula runs very short, running straight with the macrovascular layer and capillary layer, and immediately spreads to form choroidal capillary leaflets. In the small center, the capillaries are thick and then distributed radially, forming small circular, oval or long meshes between the branches. The diameter of the blood vessel gradually decreases from the center of the artery lobule to the periphery, and then changes from small to large after entering the vein lobule. Finally, it drains into the venules through a large number of posterior venules with thick and short diameters. Because the submacular choroid is supplied and drained by multiple arteries and veins, this ensures that blood flow can be quickly injected directly into the submacular blood vessels from the major arteries and quickly flows into the veins. Therefore, the submacular choroid is not only rich in blood supply, but also has rapid blood flow to supply high-energy metabolism in the macular area of the retina."}

The lobular structure gradually became clear, and the arterial leaflets and venous leaflets were still inlaid with each other, but from the sclera, it could be clearly seen that the anterior arteriole supplying the arterial leaflets ran longer, forming smaller arterial leaflets capillaries, which immediately flowed into the larger venous leaflets.

The arterial leaflets and venous leaflets can be clearly distinguished. The number of venous leaflets in the peripheral area is significantly increased, and the ratio to arterial leaflets is about 7:1. The diameter of the arterial leaflets becomes smaller and the shape is irregular. The vein leaflets are slightly larger in diameter and are triangular or pentagonal.

These anastomotic branches vary in thickness, but most of them are small and belong to the nature of arterioles or capillaries. Some have a diameter of about 31 to 61um and a length of about 450um.

When it is close to the equator of the eyeball, it gradually merges, and two and three veins merge into a small trunk, and then three or four small trunks merge into a large trunk. The three or four large trunks finally form a vortex vein. At the confluence, the veins become slightly thinner and then expand into a sac-like manner to form the ampulla. However, some expansions are not obvious or thin, and directly form thick vortex veins. The large vein located in the front of the eye collects blood from the iris, ciliary body, pars plana, as well as blood from the blood vessels in the sclera and the corneal limbus, and collects it to form a large vein. Walking from front to back to the equator, they also merge with each other and enter the vortex veins. Therefore, at the origin of the vortex vein at the equator, it is named vortex vein because a large number of veins are arranged radially or vortices around the vortex vein. The vortex veins running in the intraocular segment often have one or two branches on each side, merging into one branch before exiting the sclera, or some directly exiting the sclera without merging. It rejoins outside the eye to form a trunk. There is often stenosis at the point where the sclera exits. In human specimens, there are 4 to 7 branches in the extraocular segment of vortex veins. They are located near the equator, on either side of the superior and inferior rectus muscles.

A circular or elliptical ring is formed by anastomosis of branches of two or three, and occasionally four posterior ciliary artery. Even in the human eye, such rings can be complete or incomplete. If the branches from both sides of the short posterior ciliary artery are anastomosed with each other both above and below the optic papilla, a relatively complete vascular ring is formed, and sometimes parts of the Zinn arterial ring are double rings. If the branches of the short posterior ciliary artery from both sides are anastomosed only above or below the optic papilla, an incomplete vascular ring is formed. The following branches originate from the Zinn arterial ring: \u2460 The branch travels towards the equator to form the outer choroid artery;\u2461 The branch travels backwards to form the optic nerve pial vascular network;\u2462 Many small branches originate from around the vascular ring and run inwards to supply the anterior and cribriform cribriform areas of the optic disc;\u2463 The ciliary retinal artery originates inwards to supply the posterior polar retinal fan area."}

Through resin casting, the blood supply to the anterior cribriform region of the human eye mainly comes from the branches of the posterior ciliary artery and Zinn vascular ring, and is supplied in a divided manner. The choroidal artery also issues branches to supply this region. If the ciliary reticular artery is present, it also branches off to supply this area as it passes through the optic disc.

Since then, a large number of technical improvements and clinical research have been carried out on fluorescein angiography around the world, and it has become one of the important examination and diagnosis methods in ophthalmology. In recent years, with the rapid development of camera, video recording and computer technology, fluorescent cameras, high-resolution, low-illumination cameras and computer systems are connected to dynamically observe the entire process of fluorescein angiography directly from the TV screen, and use video tape to record it, dynamic analysis can be carried out at any time."}

The plasma membrane has no holes, and the cells are surrounded by a thick basement membrane. Outside the endothelial cells are pericytes, which have many cytoplasmic processes surrounding the blood vessel wall to support the microvessels. They also have a basement membrane itself. Surrounding the endothelial cells and pericytes is an amorphous basement membrane. Therefore, normal retinal capillaries only allow small molecules of nutrients and metabolites to pass through, while blood components and macromolecules such as sodium fluorescein cannot enter the retina through the blood vessel wall, forming an internal blood-retinal barrier.\u2461 External barrier: The connection between retinal pigment epithelial cells is a composite connection, that is, the base is a gap junction, the middle is a desmosome junction, and the top is a closed zone.

For example, retinal blood vessels receive resistance or pressure from the inside, causing the intra-vascular pressure to increase, and the blood vessel wall is stretched and expanded under pressure, causing distortion and bending, such as retinal vein obstruction, hemangioma and other diseases. Or the blood vessels are pulled from the outside and expand and distort, such as the formation of epiretinal membrane, or the pulling of blood vessels by organic tissue of the retina and\/or vitreous body can destroy the blood vessel barrier. Various blood diseases such as anemia, leukemia, etc., or arterial obstruction can cause ischemia and hypoxia of tissues and blood vessels themselves, resulting in barrier damage. Various inflammation, drugs, or metabolic products such as histamine, serotonin, or prostaglandins can dilate blood vessels and damage the barrier.

In the retinal arterial phase, the central retinal arterial system begins to fill 0.5 to 1 second after the venous vessels fill, and rapidly distributes to the entire arterial system within 1 to 2 seconds. If high-speed photography is used, it can be seen that fluorescein does not immediately fill the entire lumen, but only fills the central part of the main trunk of the suprapapilla artery at the beginning, which is called axial flow. At the arterial branch, it is divided into two strands due to dynamic relationship, each flowing along one side of the artery, forming fluorescence on one side and non-fluorescence on the other side, which is called arterial laminar flow. The fluorescent side is called the sunny side, and the non-fluorescent side is called the shady side. The arterial laminar flow is generally maintained for no more than 1 second, and soon the entire lumen is completely filled and enters the anterior arteriole and capillary network."}

In the retinal arterio-venous phase, the capillaries have begun to fill in the late arterial phase. Initially, the capillary filling shape is speckled, and soon appears as a mesh, obliges the fluorescence of the choroid. At the same time, part of the fluorescein enters the small vein and then merges into the large vein. When fluorescein enters the great vein, it first moves along one or both sides of the vein wall, but the central part of the blood vessel is not filled. This results in a phenomenon where fluorescence appears on one or both sides of the vein but no fluorescence in the center., called venous laminar flow."}

Therefore, before the central retinal artery fills, very faint hazy fluorescence begins to appear on the optic disc, and it is unevenly distributed, representing the fluorescence of the posterior ciliary artery that supplies the optic disc. From the arterial phase to the arteriovenous phase, the optic disc fluorescence reaches its peak. On the one hand, it is due to the filling of the posterior ciliary artery, and on the other hand, it is due to the filling of the dense capillary network located in the superficial nerve fiber layer, arranged radially, some extending into the area around the optic disc, and they represent the filling of the retinal arteries. In the later stage, the fluorescence of the optic papilla gradually disappears, but sometimes a semilunar-shaped fluorescence filling can be seen on the edge of the optic papilla. This may be because the pigment epithelium here has less pigment, so the fluorescence of the choroid can be seen, or because the fluorescein of the choroid around the optic papilla penetrates into the optic papilla."}

Superficial edema results from damage to superficial capillaries and is mostly distributed around the optic papilla. The retina shows white diffuse merceric edema, and the divine layer floating in the edema can be seen. The edema rarely exceeds the temporal side of the macula. Common in papilledema, papillitis, hypertensive retinopathy, etc. The edema quickly subsides after the cause of disease is removed, and stellate exudation may be left. Deep edema is caused by damage to the deep capillary bed. It mostly occurs in the posterior pole, especially the macula, and can also reach the equator or even the periphery. Edema is often located in the outer plexiform layer, and other layers are also edema. Therefore, the retina at the posterior pole is thickened or microwave-like, the central light reflection of the macula disappears, and the retina is white and cloud-like. Strong fluorescence can be seen in the late stage of silk-like reflective fluorography. Three mirror slit lamp examination showed shadows of retinal blood vessels. Long-term deep edema can form a cyst-like space in the macula area, arranged like a honeycomb or petal-like space, which is called cyst-like macular edema. In the late stage of fluorography, petal-like or\/and beehive-like fluorescein accumulation can be seen. Deep retinal edema most commonly occurs in retinal vein occlusion, diabetic retinopathy, uveitis, retinal detachment, eye tumors, etc. Deep edema is absorbed slowly and often takes several months or longer. After the edema subsides, pigment disorders are often left behind."}
{"title":"Section III\tCommon abnormal signs of fundus  3. Retinal exudation and edema","text":"2. Intracellular edema, also known as cloud swelling, mostly occurs when arterial blood supply is insufficient, such as retinal artery occlusion. Due to hypoxia and nutrition in the retina, the cells in the inner layer of the retina absorb water and become edema, turning white turbid. The affected retina becomes fog-like white swollen and becomes turbid. The degree and extent of retinal fog swelling depends on the extent of arterial jurisdiction and the time and extent of ischemia caused by obstruction. If it is only temporary incomplete obstruction of the artery and resolves quickly, the fog-like swelling of the cells can be restored, but most of them are irreversible changes, and the inner cells quickly die and are swallowed by phagocytes, resulting in gliosis.

The number of collagen fibers in the Bruch membrane is increased, and the elastic fibers gradually become calcified, which causes the Bruch membrane to become thicker, reduce its elasticity, and increase its fragility, so that metabolic products of the pigment epithelium cannot pass through the Bruch membrane and remain in the Bruch membrane. When the thickening of Bruch's membrane takes the shape of a spherical focus or a flat focus, it is clinically called drusen. The most common types are hard drusen and soft drusen. There is a light yellow, round, and well-defined, highly reflective lesion under the ophthalmoscope of rigid drusen. Most of them are distributed in the posterior pole of the retina or\/and the equator, and both eyes are basically symmetrical. Soft drusen is a large yellow focal lesion with unclear boundaries and multiple lesions often merge with each other.

Epiretinal membranes are divided into two types: idiopathic epiretinal membrane and secondary epiretinal membrane. Idiopathic disease is common in the elderly. The reason is unknown. In the lighter case, the retina in the macula area shines like gold foil, or has mild radial folds, or is accompanied by tortuosity of small blood vessels, and occasionally small bleeding spots or microhemangioma forms. The disease progresses slowly. In severe cases, there is the formation of gray and white membrane, obvious radial folds are formed by pulling the macula, and fluoroscopic imaging shows tortuous capillary vessels and possible leakage of fluorescein. Optical coherence tomography (OCT) can show obvious membrane formation, even the formation of cyst-like spatial lamina or full-thickness macular holes. Secondary membranes are more common in retinal vascular obstructive or vascular inflammatory diseases, ocular trauma, post-intraocular surgery, intraocular tumors, etc. Secondary irregular membrane shape can be distributed in various parts of the fundus. Subretinal membrane is more common in older retinal detachment or trauma or subretinal hemorrhage.

The pigment in the choroid gradually increases, forming a tiger-like fundus. The amount of fundus pigment is related to the species. Caucasian people have less pigment and black people have more pigment. Under pathological conditions, pigmentation changes, which may increase or decrease in retinal pigmentation. Hyperpigmentation is seen in certain degenerative diseases, inflammatory or traumatic diseases, lasers and after surgery. Fundus examination has different manifestations according to the cause. Those caused by inflammation or trauma have limited pigment distribution depending on the location; bone cellular pigmentation can be seen in retinitis pigmentosa; and pigmentation may be present in abnormalities in congenital vascular drainage sites.

Fluorescence leaks into the pigment epithelium defect, so the fluorescence fills slowly, is uneven, and gradually expands. The detachment of pigment epithelium is different. Because the pigment epithelium is firmly adhered to the glass membrane, limiting its detachment, the boundary is clear. The fluorescein entering from the glass membrane immediately reaches the subcutaneous layer of the pigment, so the fluorescence fills quickly and uniformly, and the boundary is clear.

{"title":"Section 5 Indocyanine green angiography  1. Principles","text":"Indocyanine green angiography (ICGA) is used to observe choroidal vessels because fluorescein angiography cannot clearly see the structure of choroidal vessels. The reasons are: \u2460 The molecular weight of fluorescein sodium is small, 332Dal. Immediately after intravenous injection, it leaks out from the choroidal capillaries with holes, so the structure of the choroidal vessels cannot be seen clearly;\u2461 The wavelength of sodium fluorescein is relatively short, and is almost completely absorbed by the retinal pigment epithelium and the macular lutein, so the choroidal microcirculation cannot be seen satisfactorily. In order to overcome the above shortcomings, the authors have done many research. In 1956, ICG was first used in medicine to observe hemodynamics of the heart and liver; in 1972, Flower successfully performed the first indocyanine green angiography in the human eye. Because indocyanine green has a large molecular weight of 775Dal, most of which is bound to plasma albumin, it hardly leaks out from the choroidal capillaries. The maximum absorption wavelength of indocyanine green is 795 - 810nm, and the maximum excitation wavelength is 835nm. The wavelength of near-infrared light is between 750nm, and infrared light is infrared light. Therefore, using near-infrared light as an excitation light source is rarely absorbed by retinal pigment epithelium and macula lutein. At the same time, near-infrared light is not easy to scatter, and can also be used for imaging patients with refractive matrix opacity, such as early cataracts. Therefore, satisfactory images of choroidal vessels can be obtained by using indocyanine green and near-infrared light as excitation sources."}

Nowadays, scanning laser ophthalmoscope (SLO) and computer image processing systems can be used to simultaneously perform fluorescence angiography and indocyanine green angiography, and the blood flow of the retina and choroid can be dynamically observed simultaneously."}

Although previous histopathological studies have shown that the inner retina (including bipolar cells and ganglion cell layers) is not damaged in patients with RP, especially in the early stages of the disease, in a recent study, Milam used immunochemical methods to find that rod cell axons establish abnormal connections with the inner retina, which seriously affects the reconstruction of normal retinal structures.

Gene therapy for patients with autosomal recessive inherited retinopathy (e.g., most LCA and most RP patients), whose genes from both parents have defects and the protein they encode is produced very little. Gene therapy increases the number of normal, functional proteins in photoreceptor cells by introducing non-defective gene sequences into photoreceptor cells. Lem et al. and Travis et al. successfully verified the above methods in animal experiments within the same year. The finding that it is possible to reintroduce defective gene sequences into genetically defective photoreceptor cells is encouraging. However, attention should be paid to the timing of gene introduction, and it must be carried out before the recipient's photoreceptor cells have completely degenerate and necrotic and the cells can still differentiate. Whether the above treatment can be performed in the advanced stage of the disease, that is, after the photoreceptor cells stop differentiation and the outer segments are completely shed and necrotic, is still inconclusive."}

Transmission electron microscope scanning showed that the outer segments of photoreceptor cells developed, with characteristic arrangements of membrane discs, whose shape was similar to that of normal wild-type cells. Significantly different from extinguished ERG in diseased animals, ERG examination in treated animals can trace a clear b-wave.

He introduced a vector containing the wild-type RPE65 gene sequence into the subretinal space of a 4-month-old Briard dog.

For the first time, the above experiments confirmed the restoration of visual function in LCA model animals with larger eyeballs (Briard dogs with RPE65 gene deletion) after gene therapy. At present, it is unclear whether the retina of LCA patients with human RPE65 gene defect is intact, whether the photoreceptor cell layer exists, and the time window for retinal cell death is unclear.

The problem with many dominant inherited eye diseases is not the lack of a certain protein (insufficient single dose), but the product of the mutant gene affects the function of the normal gene product (dominant negative effect). The purpose of treatment is to inhibit the expression of mutant genes, which can be achieved by ribozymes with specific cleavage sites. In 1997, Flannery et al. introduced a ribozyme with a specific restriction site into photoreceptor cells of experimental mice with a P23H gene defect (the most common type of gene defect in human autosomal dominant RP). This ribozyme was specially designed to be able to specifically identify and excise mutant genes, thereby reducing the expression of mutant genes."}

Before enzyme replacement therapy, gene therapy and retinal cell transplantation become possible in the future, research on the role of enzymes in metabolic pathways will help us change our diet. Slow down the progression of the disease. For example, gyrate atrophy is caused by abnormalities in enzymes related to guanylate metabolism, which causes hyperguanylate, which in turn leads to the death of photoreceptor cells and causes disease. Guanylate in the body is mainly converted from arginine. Limiting the intake of foods containing arginine can help prevent the progression of the disease.

Supplementing the above-mentioned vitamin A derivative (11-cis-retinal) to experimental animals has a positive short-term effect, and improvement in the physiological function of rod cells can be observed; but its long-term effect is unclear.

The incidence of ophthalmic artery obstruction is low, accounting for only 3%. Clinically, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish whether the ophthalmic artery is blocked or the central retinal artery and the posterior ciliary artery are blocked at the same time. Ocular artery obstruction affects visual function more seriously, and vision may be reduced to manual or no light perception. Intraocular pressure usually decreases due to the lack of blood flow in the central retinal artery and the ciliary artery that supplies the uveal tract. Since there is no blood supply to the inner and outer layers of the retina, the retina may have cotton-like spots, and the retina's milky edema and opacity are more serious. 40% of patients had no cherry red spots in the fundus. The reason was that the choroid blood flow was blocked, blood flow was stagnant, and the choroid and retinal pigment epithelium were turbid and edema due to ischemia, so the cherry red spots could not be seen. Cherry red spots may appear in some patients after improving choroidal circulation several days. Fluorescence angiography showed prolonged ARCT cycle time, prolonged retinal cycle time, filling defect of retinal and choroidal vessels, cotton wool patches showing obscuring fluorescence, and staining at the deep retinal pigment epithelium level in the late stage of angiography.

If the microhemangioma is very small, it will be difficult to detect under ophthalmoscope, but it can show point-like strong fluorescence when performed on fluorescent angiography. If it is slightly larger, small red spots as large as the tip of the needle will be observed under the ophthalmoscope. Some may be as large as 1\/2 of the blood vessel diameter. In the early stage, the number is small, and they are mostly distributed around the macula or scattered at the posterior pole of the retina. With the aggravation of retinopathy, the number of microhemangioma increases, and leakage may occur in the late stage of fluoroscopic imaging. Microhemangioma can also be located around non-perfused areas and represent a cellular proliferative response to local retinal hypoxia. Microhemangioma leakage can cause edema of nearby retinas, and long-term leakage can produce hard exudation. There is also often hemorrhage around microhemangioma. Petechial hemorrhage is often difficult to distinguish from hemangioma under ophthalmoscope. However, the bleeding boundary is blurred, the fluorescence is not full, and it can be absorbed and disappeared after a period of time. Microhemangioma, on the other hand, has clear boundaries, is filled with fluorescein, and can be distinguished if it persists for a long time. However, when some microhemangioma grows, the capsule wall thickens and may have hyaline changes. They invade the lumen and cause the hemangioma to occlude, but they will not fill during fluoroscopic imaging. Some large thin-walled microhemangioma do not fill or fill slowly and show dark silhouettes on fluoroscopic imaging. There may be stagnant and aggregation of red blood cells in the lumen.

Some bleeds have a white heart, which may be composed of aggregation of fibrin or platelets, or it may result from microhemangioma with hyaline degeneration with a white heart at the center of the bleeding. But this white heart hemorrhage is not a special significance for diabetes, it is just a symptom. If the bleeding is located in the macula, it affects vision. Multiple large spots of bleeding indicate small vein occlusion. As the condition worsens, retinal bleeding increases, indicating that the blood-retinal barrier is damaged more severely. If there are more than 20 bleeding points in any quadrant of the retina, it is a signal to enter proliferative diabetic retinopathy.

Long-term capillary lesions can lead to impaired material exchange and occlusion to form a local small non-perfusion area. Therefore, the anterior capillary arterioles and the posterior capillary venules are also compensated for irregular expansion and tortuosity. As the disease progresses, a short circuit can form from arterioles to venules due to occlusion of capillaries. Compensatory expansion of venules in the non-perfused area can lead to the formation of new blood vessels in the retina. Because these vessels are located in the retina, they are not prone to bleeding and have no fluorescein leakage during fluorescence angiography. If the new blood vessels grow and break through the internal limiting membrane, they can become pre-retinal new blood vessels, and a large amount of fluorescein leakage can occur during fluorescence angiography. Therefore, IRMA is more dangerous than hemorrhage and microhemangioma. If there is an intraretinal microvascular abnormality in more than one quadrant, it is severe non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy, which can quickly develop into proliferative diabetic retinopathy."}

Fluorescence angiography showed abnormal leakage in these microhemangioma. Hard exudation can persist for a long time, and if located in the center of the macula, vision can be reduced. It can be absorbed 3 to 6 months after laser treatment. First transported through nearby relatively intact capillaries and retinal pigment epithelium to make the edema subside. Large exudates may be cleared by phagocytosis by lipoid macrophages. Sometimes old exudates are absorbed and new exudates appear again, indicating that the disease continues to develop."}

In the late stage of imaging, diffuse edema showing beehive-like strong fluorescence may gradually dissipate, but cystoid macular edema resolves slowly and central vision is severely damaged. Diffuse edema may also intensify with the intensification of systemic edema caused by concomitant systemic diseases such as hypertension, kidney disease, or cardiovascular disease, or may improve as the systemic condition improves after treatment."}

If the disease develops, the diameter of the veins is uneven and can expand in the shape of beaded or sausage-like shape. According to the new classification, if there are clear beaded changes in more than 2 quadrants, it means that the lesion has entered a period of severe non-proliferative lesions. If several quadrant veins show bean-like dilatation, they can quickly enter the proliferative lesion stage or have entered the proliferative stage. Diabetic patients are prone to retinal vein obstruction, which is sometimes difficult to distinguish. Patients with diabetes should be carefully observed whether the lesions in both eyes are symmetrical. If one eye bleeds particularly heavily and distributed along the veins, while the other eye bleeds little, the possibility of vein obstruction should be considered."}
{"title":"Section 2 Diabetic Retinopathy  3. Non-proliferative diabetic retinopathy","text":"7. Vascular occlusion in diabetic retinopathy The earliest seen vascular occlusion occurs in capillaries. Fluorescence angiography showed a small non-perfused area surrounded by telangiectasia and microhemangioma formation. It suggests that microhemangioma formation is a response to local vascular occlusion. Capillary occlusion is scattered in the middle periphery and posterior pole of the retina. The most obvious feature of fluorescence angiography occurs in the capillary bed around the macula. Because the central retinal pigment epithelium contains more pigment grains, it enhances the contrast of capillary and choroid background fluorescence. The central capillaries of the macula have only one layer of blood vessels forming the macula arch ring, which is susceptible to damage by diabetes. The normal central Foveal avascular zone (FAZ) is round or ovoid, with a longest diameter of about 650um. In diabetic retinopathy, the capillaries are occluded, making the capillary space larger, the arch ring breaks, making the FAZ boundary irregular, and at the same time the FAZ expands. When FAZ is mildly or moderately enlarged, macula blood flow can still maintain normal vision. When the maximum diameter of FAZ exceeds 1000um, vision is reduced due to macula ischemia. This has been confirmed clinically and pathologically. Digestive paving technology was used to find that the occluded capillaries at the expansion of the macular arch ring had no cellular structure, while the capillaries perfused around them expanded and increased cells. It suggests that telangiectasia may be a physiological response to retinal hypoxia. As diabetes develops, it develops from occlusion of capillaries to occlusion of anterior arterioles and even arterioles. It starts at the bifurcation of the artery, usually starting from the terminal arterioles, and later, the larger arterioles are occluded, creating a large area of non-perfusion. These non-perfused areas mostly occur in the middle periphery of the retina. As the disease worsens, the non-perfused areas increase, which can generate new blood vessels and enter proliferative diabetic retinopathy."}

At the same time, it grows along the great retinal vessels, especially along the superior or infratemporal vascular arches. In the late stage of new blood vessels, fibrous hyperplasia occurs. When the small new blood vessels begin to degenerate, the diameter becomes smaller, the number decreases, and are finally replaced by white fibrous tissue. If fibrous hyperplasia occurs near the macula, the macula can be pulled to dislodge or form radial folds. Large neovascular hyperplasia fibers are thick and can protrude into the posterior vitreous body, causing posterior vitreous detachment. If the proliferative fibers contract and the traction new blood vessels rupture, preretinal hemorrhage or vitreous hemorrhage can occur. Repeated vitreous hemorrhage can cover up the fundus, resulting in unclear fundus and severe vision loss. Extensive fibrous hyperplasia and vitreous traction can also lead to retinal detachment."}

The most typical changes in the fundus are retinal exudation and vascular abnormalities. In the early stage, the optic disc is normal, the macula is normal or invaded. The lesion site can start in any quadrant of the fundus, but it is common on the temporal side and starts at the periphery of the retina. The lesion is limited to one quadrant or throughout the periphery of the fundus. Vision is impaired if the lesion surrounds the optic disc and macula. The blood vessels at the lesion were obviously abnormal, with capillaries dilated, and both arteries and veins were damaged, especially the small arteries. The lesions mainly occurred in the second or third small branches of the blood vessels. The blood vessels were dilated and deformed, and the vessel walls were cyst-like, fusiform, or bean-like hemangioma, or arranged in a beaded shape. The blood vessels can also be wreath-shaped, spiral, knotted torturous or straightened. Large hemangioma can produce massive exudation and bleeding, and may be accompanied by new blood vessels and communicating branches between the vessels. Due to damage to the blood-retinal barrier, serous exudation and bleeding occur, resulting in large exudation. When the exudation is white or yellow-white dots or fused into pieces, arranged into irregular strips, semi-rings or rings, it is called ring-like retinopathy. The exudation is located under the retinal blood vessels deep in the retina and can also partially cover the blood vessels. Exudative elevations can reach several diopters, so they are also called extraexudative retinopathy. Spot bright cholesterol crystal bodies and spot and sheet bleeding are often seen near the exudation. Pigmentation is occasionally seen. If the lesion is near the macula, it may invade the macula, causing edema or star-like exudation. In severe cases, the macula forms organized scars in the late stage."}
{"title":"Section IV\tOther retinal vascular diseases  1. Coats disease","text":"As the disease progresses, the optic nipple may be congested, the vitreous body may be punctate opacities, the large blood vessels may be dilated and filled, hemangioma may increase, and the lesion area may expand. In the late stage, massive exudation increases and occupies the entire fundus. At the same time, the increase causes the retinal sphere to detach, with the color being yellow-white and slightly dark or dark green. Abnormal changes in blood vessels on detached retina, or abnormal changes such as hemangioma are found on non-detached retina. Sometimes massive bleeding occurs during development and can flow into the vitreous body, causing vitreous opacity. In some cases, large exudates bulge into the posterior capsule of the lens to form a white pupil, resembling a retinoblastoma. Finally, subretinal and intraretinal exudation organizes and is replaced by scar tissue. The vitreous body also proliferates due to organization of bleeding, resulting in proliferative vitreoretinopathy."}

Arterio-venous shorts can be seen near the aneurysm and non-perfused area, where blood flow is slow. New blood vessels may form near the lesion area, and their ends often have strong fluorescent bristles and leakage of fluorescein. The exudation from the lesion area can be stained with fluorescein to show strong fluorescence in sheets. If there is a large area of bleeding, masking fluorescence appears.

The disease can also be induced if birth is accompanied by other diseases, such as intrauterine hypoxia, cyanosis, suffocation, urgent breathing syndrome, pneumothorax, intraventricular bleeding, anemia, congenital patent ductus arteriosus, and heart disease. Because these diseases often cause hypoxia in the retinal tissue, the disease can occur even if oxygen is not used.

Abnormal blood vessels run from the optic disc to the equator of the retina. In mild cases, they may be confined to one quadrant of the retina, and in severe cases, they may involve the entire retinal blood vessels. Retinal blood vessels are abnormally dilated and tortuous, and their diameter can be 4 to 8 times larger than that of normal people. Because arterial blood flow flows directly into veins, it is sometimes difficult to distinguish between arteries and veins. These blood vessels rarely leak, so there is no retinal edema or exudation.

Foreign reports have reported that the incidence of cystoid macular edema in untreated patients with branch vein obstruction are 58% and 62%, respectively. We calculated that the incidence of cystic edema caused by total stem obstruction was 65.9%, and branch obstruction was 39.6%. The cause of cystoid edema is venous obstruction, obstruction of reflux, elevated intravascular pressure, and damage to capillary endothelial cell barriers. When the amount of edema increases and the time is prolonged, water penetrates into the retinal tissue to form edema. Especially in the macula area, there are abundant Henle fibers arranged in radial shapes, which can easily absorb water. If not absorbed for a long time, it can lead to degeneration of nerve tissue, disappearance of intermediate fibers, and fusion of small vesicles into larger vesicles. There are no blood vessels in the center of the macula, and the vesicles where water collects in the center are larger, while the vesicles outside the center are smaller and arranged like beehives. If edema is long-term, it can persist for a long time until pigment epithelium hyperplasia and macula scar forms."}

The incidence of cystoid macular edema after cataract surgery varies from one report to another. The incidence of extracapsular extraction combined with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation is %. Its shape is the same as cystic edema caused by other reasons, but it is mild. There are three reasons for cystic edema: \u2460 Inflammation theory: Surgery can increase the contents of prostaglandins, especially PGE-2, causing inflammation. These substances are produced by the anterior uveal tract and absorbed by the ciliary epithelium. If large quantities are produced before absorption, they can spread backwards through the vitreous cavity and cause damage to the capillary barrier around the macula. Especially in cases with posterior lens capsule rupture and vitreous prolapse during the operation, cystoid edema is more likely to occur.\u2461 Traction theory: Cystoid macular edema is more likely to occur after cataract surgery, especially in cases with vitreous prolapse and vitreous embedding wounds. Due to the contraction and widening of the pupil, the anterior glass is pulled, and the pulling force is transmitted to the base of the vitreous body. The vitreous body is connected to the macula, which causes edema by pulling the macula.\u2462 Hypoxia theory: Because cataracts mostly occur in the elderly, they are often accompanied by hypertension, arteriosclerosis and diabetes. Cystoid macular edema is more likely to occur in these patients. The above three factors may exist at the same time and are related rather than caused by a single factor. Cystoid macular edema can also occur after glaucoma surgery and retinal detachment surgery."}

Exudation or bleeding spots; in more obvious cases, dark red round spots in the macula area can be seen arranged in petals or radial shapes. Late cystic edema subsides, vesicles flatten, and in mild cases, foveal light reflex reappears; or pigment epithelium is damaged, with pigment hyperplasia or loss.

The lighter ones are very small and the number is small. In the heavier case, the vesicles are arranged in a fan shape or radial shape, and some are also arranged in a circular shape. Generally, the central vesicle is large and can be composed of 2 to 4 larger vesicles, surrounded by honeycomb-shaped vesicles. The small extent of cystoid edema may be limited to the central area of the macula, while the large extent may invade the entire macula area and be located between the upper and lower vascular arches. The nasal side can reach the temporal side of the optic papilla, and the temporal side can exceed the vascular arch. After a long time of edema, the vesicles become small and larger, and gradually merge into a large vesicle. The vesicle wall is thin. Using narrow slit light, the projection of blood vessels can be seen. Through the thin anterior wall, it can be seen that there are pigment granules hyperplasia or hard exudation on the posterior wall of the vesicle. Sometimes there may be blood in the vesicle, forming a small liquid plane in the vesicle, and the blood is crescent shaped by ophthalmoscopy. This kind of blood is more difficult to absorb than ordinary retinal hemorrhage and can last for a long time. In a few cases, the vesicles ruptured, forming laminar ruptures."}
{"title":"Section V\tComplications of retinal vascular disease  1.

The more severe the case, the earlier the leakage occurs and the faster the speed. During the arterial and venous period, the macula capillaries are filled and dilated like tumors, and some macula arches rupture. In the early stage of imaging, there was point-like leakage of fluorescein in the macula area, and in the late stage of imaging, the leakage of fluorescein became stronger and stronger. Because the Henle fibers are arranged radially in the macula area, the microcapsule-like punctate leaks are arranged in a star or radial shape around the non-vascular area and along the Henle fibers. In the late stage, the leakage in the center of the macula increases, accumulating to form petal-like strong fluorescence. The petals can be located in the center with 3 petals or 5 petals. The scope of leakage can vary in size according to different causes and degrees, and can occupy the macula area or the entire macula, with an area ranging from 1\/2DD to 4~5DD. In severe patients, typical petal shapes form 5 minutes after injection of fluorescein, and most of them occur within 10 to 15 minutes. It became more obvious after 30 minutes, when most of the fluorescein in the blood vessels had been emptied, and the background fluorescence also subsided, forming a clear contrast with the petal-shaped strong fluorescence, making the petal-shaped and beehive-like fluorescein leakage more obvious."}

The general pathological changes are as follows: the cyst-like space is located in the outer plexiform layer or Henle fibrous layer. Some are also located in the nuclear core layer, ganglion cell layer and nerve fiber layer. In most cases, the cyst-like space is located in multiple layers of the retina. The cyst-like space contains aqueous or low-protein fluid, and HE staining is light red. The cystic space is confined to the macula or diffusely distributed in the posterior pole, and some may extend from the temporal side of the optic disc to the equator. Due to the pushing of the cyst-like space, the inner and outer nuclear layers of the retina are locally thinned, the nuclei are pushed and displaced, and the visual cells are reduced or disappeared. In cases of severe edema, the cyst-like space can be very large and high, causing the internal limiting membrane to rupture and form laminar rupture. Sometimes the rupture affects the entire layer to form superficial retinal detachment. Pigment epithelium may form vacuoles, or pigment epithelium may become thinner and atrophied. Some show pigment epithelium proliferation and retinal vessel wall thickening. Although the pathological characteristics of different etiologies can be similar, they are also different, and this difference can reflect different etiologies and different severity of the disease."}

How large is the area of the non-perfused area to produce new blood vessels? Reports vary from one to another. Generally, if more than 5 to 7DD, new blood vessels may occur. The larger the area of the non-perfused area, the higher the risk of new blood vessels."}
{"title":"Section V\tComplications of retinal vascular disease  2. Retinal neovascularization","text":"The formation of new blood vessels is a response of tissues to hypoxia and is required for retinal metabolism. Ashton once pointed out that three prerequisites must be met for the formation of new blood vessels: \u2460 there is still living tissue in the retina;\u2461 hypoxia; and \u2462 damage to the drainage veins. Recent studies have shown that retinal ischemia can induce the release of many neovascular growth factors or vasculogenic factors. These factors stimulate the residual vascular endothelial cells next to the non-perfusion area to release plasminogen activators, which converts plasminogen into plasmin. They act on the vascular matrix to degrade glycoproteins such as fibronectin. At the same time, it can also activate tissue collagenase to dissolve the capillary basement membrane. Endothelial cells proliferate and grow from the gaps where the basement membrane dissolves, and the cells begin to form new blood vessel buds, similar to the development of fetal retinal blood vessels. Then the proliferating cells protrude from the blood vessel wall to form solid cords. Vascular buds connect with adjacent vascular buds to form rings, which then develop to form lumens. Once the lumens are formed, circulation begins to be established. The newly formed blood vessel wall has holes, especially near the top of the new blood vessel, so the permeability is enhanced and serous leakage is formed. New blood vessels have thin walls and are easy to rupture to form vitreous hemorrhage. The holes in the blood vessel wall at the base of the new blood vessel are reduced, and tight connections are formed between cells, so the base does not leak."}
{"title":"Section V\tComplications of retinal vascular disease  2. Retinal neovascularization","text":"(3) Morphology and outcome of new blood vessels"}
{"title":"Section V\tComplications of retinal vascular disease  2. Retinal neovascularization","text":"Normal retinal blood vessels are located in the inner 6 layers of the retina. New blood vessels initially grow in the retina and are called intraretinal new blood vessels. Due to the limitations of the internal limiting membrane, they do not cause bleeding. At first, the new blood vessels were very small. As the disease progressed and time went by, the new blood vessels gradually expanded, branches grew and entered the surface of the retina. Their shapes can be varied, such as forming dots, petal-shaped, butterfly, wheel-shaped, sea group fan shape or fan shape. When they break through the inner limiting membrane, they can grow freely and grow larger into clusters. If the non-perfused area is large, it can lead to neovascularization in the optic disc. New blood vessels grow vertically from the retina into the vitreous body, connect with the posterior vitreous collagen surface or enter the vitreous body, forming a scaffold of proliferating blood vessels where the vitreous collagen thickens, and blood vessels grow along this scaffold. It is also accompanied by cell proliferation, such as spindle cells and fibroblasts. Finally, the new blood vessels are covered by fibrous tissue. Fibroblasts can contract and stretch to form retinal detachment. The origin of fibroblasts is unclear and not in normal retinas. One may come from hyalocytes, and the other may come from retinal pigment epithelium or be transformed from pericytes. Finally, vascular proliferation and fiber proliferation stopped. Certain small new blood vessels can retract, such as retinopathy of prematurity, which can retract if blood circulation improves. However, large new blood vessels may be formed with nutrient arteries and drainage veins, which may cause repeated bleeding, and finally form organized tissue, causing many complications."}

After being irradiated by light of a specific wavelength, it is excited from the ground state to the excited state. During the transformation to the ground state or triple state, energy is released and transferred to oxygen.

However, with the advancement of medical science, especially genetics, many degenerative diseases with unknown causes in the past have now known some of their genetic information. For example, more than 100 gene mutations related to retinitis pigmentosa have been discovered. Studies have shown that in retinochoroidal degeneration and dystrophy diseases, diseases with the same clinical manifestation may be related to multiple pathogenic genes, and abnormalities in the same gene may also have completely different clinical manifestations. For example, more than a dozen related genes have been found in cone-rod dystrophy, and various abnormalities in the peripherin gene can cause various clinical manifestations such as retinitis pigmentosa, cone-rod dystrophy, or graphic dystrophy. Therefore, many genetic and degenerative diseases may intersect in clinical manifestations, and each disease has a different clinical process and its manifestations are different.

Multiple fixed folds can appear on the detached retina. Whether retinal detachment occurs after a foreign body remains in the eye is related to many factors, such as the nature of the foreign body, whether it is complicated by endophthalmitis, vitreous hemorrhage, and the time of the operation. The persistent effect of intraocular foreign bodies on intraocular tissues can cause a series of complications. Intraocular infection is one of the serious complications and one of the causes of retinal detachment. Foreign bodies in the vitreous body can also cause the formation of organized strips and organized films in the vitreous body.

The mechanism and clinical manifestations are similar to that when a penetrating injury is accompanied by obvious vitreous prolapse. Retinal tears often occur on the opposite side of the corneoscleral limbus incision and are caused by traction of the vitreous body embedded in the incision. When subretinal fluid is discharged during retinal detachment replacement surgery, due to improper selection of the position of the drainage port, new retinal tears are generated or vitreoretinal incarceration at the drainage port, resulting in traction retinal detachment."}

Under the action of TGF-Beta2, RPE cells can transform into stellate cells, Fibroblasts and collagen cells secrete fibronectin and collagen and form them, which have the effect of contracting and pulling the retina; it can be seen that the occurrence of PVR is very similar to the final maturity and the occurrence and development of fruits: the migrating RPE cells in PVR-the seeds that produce fruits, the growth factors released after the destruction of BRBs-the fertilizers that promote the growth and development of seeds, and the microenvironment of the vitreoretinal retina-the soil where seeds grow and develop are indispensable.

In order to choose reasonable treatment measures and conduct a unified and objective evaluation of the efficacy, the American Retinal Society uniformly named it as proliferative vitreoretinopathy in 1983. In 1983, PVR classification was carried out. In 1991, it was improved. The new classification retained grades A and B, modified grade C, removed grade D, and introduced the concept of anterior PVR. Grade C lesions are bounded by the equator, and anterior PVR is represented by: posterior PVR is represented by the equator; Each type of contraction of Class C is described in detail.

Long-term contact may make it difficult to reposition due to retinal adhesion. Mild choroidal detachment usually disappears after 1 to 2 weeks, leaving few traces, and some may show mottled proliferation and depigmentation of pigment epithelium. Long-term choroidal detachment accompanied by hypotony can cause a series of changes such as optic disc and macula edema, vascular dilation and tortuosity, and choroidal folds."}

Choroidal detachment caused by post-traumatic hypotony requires ward rounds and UBM to exclude ciliary body dialysis."}
{"title":"Section VIII\tchoroidal detachment","text":"[Treatment]"}
{"title":"Section VIII\tchoroidal detachment","text":"1. Serous choroidal detachment can usually be treated conservatively. Generally, choroidal detachment occurring after intraocular surgery can be relieved within several days to several weeks by using cycloplegic agents, hormones, etc.(topical application or oral treatment) without surgical treatment. When there is wound leakage or filtering bleb leakage after anti-glaucoma surgery, local pressure bandage, wound suture, adhesive or corneal contact lenses, or a combination of the above methods can be used. However, for those with refractory shallow anterior chamber or progressive anterior chamber shallowness, especially those with inflammatory reactions, which are prone to forming peripheral anterior synechia, those with long-term contact between the cornea and the iris and lens, which may lead to decompensation of the corneal endothelium, and those with kissing choroidal detachment that is prone to rhegmatogenous or traction retinal detachment, anterior chamberoplasty and sclerotomy to drain suprachoroidal effusion should be performed. The outflow rate of accumulated fluid should be controlled during the operation, otherwise the pulse will easily drop again. Because patients with elderly, highly myopic eyes and glaucoma are prone to choroidal detachment after surgery, oral tone-lowering drugs should be administered before surgery, and adequate massage should be used to compress the eyeball to reduce intraocular pressure after retrobulbar anesthesia. Gentle surgical procedures during surgery and slow release of aqueous humor after incision of the anterior chamber to reduce intraocular pressure can effectively avoid the occurrence of complications of choroidal detachment."}
{"title":"Section VIII\tchoroidal detachment","text":"2. Localized bleeding due to hemorrhagic choroidal detachment is usually treated conservatively and resolves spontaneously within a month. Locally paralyzed agents and hormones can be used. Surgical treatment is required when the following conditions occur: large bleeding, obvious pain, uncontrollable high intraocular pressure, persistent shallow anterior chamber, choroidal detachment in the macular area, bleeding and other complications such as retinal detachment, vitreous hemorrhage, and anti-kiss choroidal detachment can lead to secondary traction or rhegmatogenous retinal detachment. The timing of surgery is generally 7 to 14 days after surgery. At this time, blood clots are basically melted and easy to release, and corneal edema and intraocular inflammatory reactions also tend to subside. B-ultrasound examination was performed before surgery to determine the part of the suprachoroidal space with the most blood accumulation, liquefaction status, and vitreoretinal status. The main surgical steps include: periconjunctival incision and traction of four rectus muscles; anterior chamber plasty and anterior chamber irrigation. An infusion needle can be inserted from the corneoscleral limbus for continuous perfusion; scleral incision is performed at the highest point of choroid detachment. After surgery, the wound can be sutured to restore ocular integrity, or drainage can be opened to continue. The infratemporal quadrant is often chosen for the incision, but other quadrant incisions can also be made according to actual conditions. Place the vitrectomy perfusion tube; introduce the optical fiber and vitrectomy instruments, paying attention to introducing them slowly parallel to the iris plane to avoid damaging the retina that has shifted forward, and then perform vitreoretinal reattachment surgery."}

It has been reported that the sclera thickness of true microphthalmos is greater than that of normal eyes, up to 2 mm. The disease can also occur in normal-sized eyes. The sclera has been found to be thickened, or the sclera is not thickened but its composition is abnormal. In pathological specimens, it was found that aminoglycans and mucins are accumulated in the sclera tissue. Aminoglycans are highly hydrophilic and absorb water to thicken the sclera; The shape of sclera cells is abnormal, the nucleus is reduced and denatured, the cytoplasm is reduced or absent, and the cell organelles disappear; the sclera fibers are arranged in disorder, the structure is blurred, and there is a large number of granular deposits between the collagen fibers.

{"title":"","text":"The optic nerve is part of the central nervous system. It is composed of axons of retinal ganglion cells and is an important part of conducting visual signals. The optic nerve fibers pass through the cribriform plate of the sclera and enter the intracranial through the orbit. The surface is covered by three layers of sheath extending from the intracranial dura, arachnoid and pial mater. There are rich sensory nerve fibers in the sheath. The blood supply to the optic nerve and the brain comes from the internal carotid artery, so lesions that occur in the optic nerve are usually related to lesions in the central nervous system."}
{"title":"","text":"Nerve fibers formed by axons of ganglion cells gather about 3mm on the nasal side of the macula at the posterior pole of the eyeball to form a disk structure with a diameter of about 1.5 mm, commonly called the optic papilla, also known as the optic disc. The optic nerve refers to a section of nerve fibers from the surface of the optic papilla to the optic chiasm, with a total length of about 50 - 60 mm. It is divided into the intrabulbar segment, the intraorbital segment, the intratubular segment and the intracranial segment. The intrabulbar segment refers to the part from the posterior sclera foramen to the surface of the optic disc. It is about 1mm long and has a diameter of about 1.5 mm at the retinal level. The plane of the choroid glass membrane is only 1mm in diameter. The optic nerve behind the cribriform plate is surrounded by myelin sheath, and its diameter increases to 3 mm. The optic nerve in the intrabulbar segment is divided into four parts, from the inside to the outside, it is the surface of the optic disc, the anterior cribriform plate area, the cribriform plate area and the posterior cribriform plate area. The nerve fiber layer on the surface of the optic papilla is equivalent to the nerve fiber layer of the retina. It is composed of all nerve fibers from the retina. The surface is covered with radial protrusions of Muller cells to form the inner limiting membrane, which borders the vitreous body. The nerve fibers from all parts of the retina enter the optic disc in strict order: the nerve fibers in the superior temporal quadrant bypass the macula area and enter the superior temporal area of the optic disc in an arcuate manner; the fibers in the inferior temporal area bypass the macula area and enter the inferior temporal area of the optic disc in an arcuate manner; the fibers in the superior and inferior nasal quadrants radiate into the superior and inferior areas of the optic disc, respectively. The fibers in the macula area form a papilla macular bundle that directly enters the temporal side of the optic disc. The area of the macula area is 1\/20 of the entire retina. Its fibers are large and densely arranged, accounting for 65% of the total number of retinal fibers and 1\/3 of the optic nerve section. The center of the optic papilla is called the physiological depression, and the central retinal artery and central vein pass through it. The anterior cribriform area is at the retinal and choroid plane beyond the ganglion cells. The nerve fibers travel behind the eyeball in a 90\u00b0 curve and exit the eyeball. The anterior cribriform region also has a glial rim of the optic disc that separates the optic disc from the retina and choroid. The optic nerve forms the cribriform area at a position equivalent to 1\/3 of the posterior foramen of the sclera, and nerve fibers pass through the cribriform plate of the sclera in bundles. The nerve fibers of the retina are non-myelinated fibers before the cribriform plate area, and each nerve fiber after entering the cribriform plate area begins to be covered with myelin sheath. The optic papilla is a place where nerve fibers are concentrated and there are no photoreceptor cells. It becomes a blind spot in the field of vision, called a physiological blind spot."}
{"title":"","text":"The surface of the optic disc is supplied by capillaries in the central retinal artery. These capillaries communicate with deep capillaries from the short posterior ciliary artery. Through the radial capillaries around the optic disc surface and the optic disc, they enter the central retinal vein and return. The blood supply to the anterior and cribriform cribriform areas mainly comes from the small branches of the short posterior ciliary artery forming the small concentric branches of the Zinn-Haller ring in the sclera around the optic disc. In addition to the branches of the Zinn arterial ring, the posterior cribriform region may also be supplied by the branches of the pial vascular network. Most studies believe that except for the surface of the optic disc, the central retinal artery has no branches supplying the anterior optic nerve, and that the capillaries that branch from the retrobulbar central retinal artery and enter the pial mater also participate in supplying the optic nerve fibers in the optic nerve fiber membrane. The diameters of capillaries in each layer of the optic disc are different. The posterior region of the sieve plate has the thickest diameter, the superficial level, and the anterior region and the sieve plate region are the thinnest, so ischemic changes are prone to occur. There is tight connection between endothelial cells in the capillary wall in the optic papilla, forming a blood-optic nerve barrier, so no fluorescein leakage occurs during fundus fluorescein angiography in normal optic papilla. The part from the posterior sclera foramen to the intraorbital opening of the optic canal is called the intraorbital segment, which is about 30mm long and curved in an S-shape. The position where the optic nerve enters the eyeball is slightly above the nasal side 3mm from the posterior pole of the eyeball. The part of the optic nerve located in the optic canal is about 10mm long and is called the canal segment. The intracranial segment refers to the part from the anterior edge of the optic chiasm to the optic foramen, approximately 16 mm. Lesions that occur in and beyond the optic chiasm belong to the contents of neuroophthalmology. Lesions that occur in the optic nerve usually include congenital abnormalities of the optic nerve, inflammation, degeneration, vascular diseases, trauma, tumors, etc. This chapter only introduces a few of the common lesions. The intraorbital part is followed by the optic chiasm, optic tract, lateral geniculate body, optic radiation and cortical striation area, which together constitute the optic path."}
{"title":"","text":"The optic nerve is closely related to the intracranial nervous system in terms of embryogenesis, anatomical shape, histological structure and function. Optic neuropathy is actually a manifestation of many central nervous system diseases on the optic nerve, or many visual dysfunction not only reflects the optic nerve lesions, but may also be one of the clinical manifestations of the intracranial lesions themselves, such as optic disc edema, optic nerve atrophy, visual field defect, and decreased vision. Therefore, when examining and diagnosing optic neuropathy clinically, the possibility of patients developing other nervous system diseases should be fully considered. It is necessary to perform imaging examinations (such as cranial CT examinations, MRI examinations, etc.). These imaging examinations can not only exclude organic lesions related to the optic nerve and the visual path, but also exclude or discover lesions in brain tissue."}

The most common ones are optic papilla edema, optic neuritis, optic nerve vascular circulation disorders, and optic nerve atrophy."}

{"title":"section I\tof papilledema","text":"[Mechanism] The optic nerve is surrounded by the dura mater, arachnoid and pial mater. There is cerebral effusion in the subarachnoid space, which reaches the periphery of the optic nerve forward and communicates with the intracranial subarachnoid space rearward. When the intracranial pressure increases, the pressure in the subarachnoid space also increases, which causes circulation at the optic disc to be blocked and causes optic disc edema. In recent years, it has been believed that there is a certain relationship between optic disc swelling and obstruction of axoplasmic transport. Axoplasmic transport of the optic nerve is the transport of matter from the axons of retinal ganglion cells to the entire optic nerve, and finally to the lateral geniculate body, where some matter is degraded and returned to the cell body through a retrograde transport system. This operation is called axoplasmic flow and has two components: fast and slow. Axoplasmic transport terminates at the cribriform plate, and the transport of axoplasmic flow depends on the physiological pressure difference between the intraocular pressure and the optic nerve pressure. When the intracranial pressure increases, the pressure in the subarachnoid space of the optic nerve also increases, causing axoplasmic transport to be blocked in the cribriform plate, causing swelling of the optic disc to form optic papilla edema, which blocks venous return in the cribriform plate area, expands and leaks, and fluid retention between tissues further blocks axoplasmic transport, forming a vicious cycle, and makes optic papilla edema more serious."}

The area of the optic disc becomes larger, and there are edema, hemorrhage, exudation and cotton wool spots on the surface and surrounding retina, which can spread to the macula area, causing macula edema. If the primary lesion is removed in time, papilledema can subside within a few months and some vision is preserved. If pressed for a long time, the optic nerve will eventually atrophy, the optic papilla will turn pale, the bleeding will be absorbed, and the blood vessels will become thinner and have white sheaths."}

In clinical practice, the definition of optic neuritis actually refers to some specific clinical manifestations of syndromes, including lesions with these syndromes that manifest when the optic nerve is damaged due to vascular lesions, local compression or other unknown factors. It seems more reasonable to call this type of optic nerve disease an optic nerve disease. The diagnosis as optic neuritis does not include inflammatory lesions that are classified as demyelinating lesions, immune lesions, infections, spread of inflammation in adjacent tissues, and inflammatory lesions that involve some optic nerves at the same time as the retina and choroid."}
{"title":"Section II\toptic neuritis","text":"Optic neuritis is usually divided into two types based on the location of the disease: those that occur in the inner segment of the optic nerve are called papilitis, and those that occur after the posterior segment are called optic neuritis or retrobulbar optic neuritis. The optic nerve fibers of the papillo-macula tract pass through the posterior sclera aperture and are located on the temporal side of the optic nerve, and are located in the center of the optic nerve at a distance of 10 - 15 mm. When the optic nerve in this area is inflammation, it is also called axial optic neuritis. When the lesion mainly invades the optic nerve sheath and surrounding nerve fibers, it is optic perineuritis; when the entire cross section of the optic nerve is affected by inflammation, it is transverse optic neuritis. According to the severity of inflammation, it can be clinically divided into acute retrobulbar neuritis and chronic retrobulbar neuritis."}

Therefore, special attention should be paid to the patient's or child's history of systemic diseases for the history of optic neuritis, including infectious diseases (such as respiratory infections and gastrointestinal infections), nervous system symptoms (such as paraesthesia in limbs, ataxia, diplopia, urinary incontinence) and the presence of virus infection in the home or close contacts.

{"title":"Section III\toptic disc vasculitis","text":"Optic disc vasculitis, also known as papillophlebitis, is an inflammation confined to the blood vessels within the optic nerve papilla and usually occurs in the veins of the optic disc. The disease can occur in both men and women, and is more common in young adults. The disease occurs in one eye, and occasionally the disease occurs in both eyes. This lesion is not very rare and has been recognized for a long time. It was only classified as lesions such as optic nerve edema and vein obstruction before the 1960s. Clinical research on this lesion since the 1970s has gradually recognized that it is an inflammation of blood vessels confined to the optic nerve papilla. The disease was first reported in 1961 by Lyle and Wybar as a diagnosis of retinal vasculitis. In 1972, Heyreh diagnosed this lesion as optic disc vasculitis based on the clinical characteristics of the case he observed and similar case reports in the past. According to the clinical characteristics of the disease, it is usually divided into two types: that is, inflammation of the small branches of the ciliary blood vessels in the optic disc causes optic disc edema, which is called type I optic disc vasculitis; inflammation of the central retinal vein and its branches in the optic disc causes central retinal vein obstruction, which is called type II optic disc vasculitis. The pathogenesis may be that mild non-specific vasculitis occurs in the posterior ciliary vessels supplying the anterior cribriform area of the optic disc. The permeability of capillaries increases, causing exudate to accumulate in the loose anterior cribriform area tissue, leading to optic papilla edema. The edema itself can compress the central retinal vein, blocking blood flow, and dilate the blood vessel, exacerbating the degree of optic papilla edema."}

It is generally believed that the central retinal artery has no branches supplying the anterior part of the optic nerve. Capillae originating from the central retinal artery behind the bulbar supply part of the supporting fibrous septum between the optic nerve bundles. The anterior cribriform plate region, cribriform plate region and part of the posterior cribriform plate region of the optic disc are supplied by small concentric branches of the Zinn-Haller vascular ring formed by the short posterior ciliary artery. Clinical and experimental studies have shown that the occurrence of ischemic optic neuropathy is caused by low perfusion pressure caused by posterior ciliary arterial circulation disturbance, rather than by thrombus or thrombus formation. Ischemia of the small branches of the choroidal artery around the optic disc caused conduction dysfunction of the optic nerve fiber bundles before and after the cribriform plate."}
{"title":"Section IV\tischemic optic neuropathy","text":"Each small branch artery of the Zinn-Haller vascular ring supplies the optic disc with different divisions. When the supply area of one or more small arteries becomes ischemic, the optic nerve fibers in the supply area can undergo a series of pathological changes and dysfunction caused by ischemia. The venous reflux of the optic nerve mainly passes through the central retinal vein and drainage channels around the optic disc. When small branch vessels in the optic nerve are infarcted and ischemic, the veins can expand and form anastomosis with other veins around the optic disc. When the blood supply to the optic nerve is affected and ischemic lesions occur, it is called ischemic optic neuropathy (ION). Because the disease site is mainly on the optic disc, and various degrees of optic papilla edema occur at the time of the disease, it is also called anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION). Ischemic changes that occur in the optic nerve at the point where the central retinal artery enters the retrobulbar optic nerve (9 - 10mm retrobulbar) to the optic chiasma are called posterior ischemic optic neuropathy (PION). Because the lesion is located backward, papilla edema does not occur, and it is not clinically distinguishable from retrobulbar optic neuritis. Since the structure and blood vessel arrangement of both eyes are usually relatively consistent in terms of anatomical characteristics, the locations of lesions are often very similar in patients with both eyes, and the visual field defects in both eyes are mostly symmetrical."}

It is generally believed that the occurrence of this optic neuropathy is caused by local vascular sclerosis and is related to many systemic factors. Common ones are: \u2460 Vascular degenerative changes: thinning or blocking the blood vessels supplying the optic papilla, resulting in insufficient blood supply, common in vascular diseases such as hypertension, arteriosclerosis, and diabetes;\u2461 Vasculitis occlusion: mainly seen in temporal arteritis, vascular inflammation such as polyarteritis nodosa;\u2462 Changes in blood component viscosity: When the blood viscosity increases, it can lead to slow blood flow, reduced oxygen contents, and hypoxia in the optic disc. Common cases include severe anemia, polycythemia, etc.;\u2463 Blood loss: When blood loss occurs, the perfusion pressure of small vessels decreases, and the optic disc is ischemic; \u2463 Increased intraocular pressure: The balance between blood pressure and intraocular pressure in the small vessels of the optic disc is unbalanced, causing circulation disorders, and ischemia due to poor blood flow, occurring in patients with glaucoma."}

When ischemic optic neuropathy occurs in both eyes at the same time, the impact of systemic diseases should be considered, such as intracranial vascular disease, renal hypertension, etc. Most patients find symptoms of vision loss when getting up in the morning, which is related to low perfusion pressure caused by factors such as nocturnal hypotension, optic disc autonomic nervous dysfunction, and taking blood-pressure-lowering drugs before going to bed in elderly patients.

{"title":"Section IV\tischemic optic neuropathy","text":"2. Fundus examination showed that the optic disc became lighter in color, blurred in boundaries, and showed grayish-white edema. Since the deep layer of the optic papilla is supplied by different small branches of the posterior short ciliary artery, each branch supplies a certain range. After the small blood vessels in different locations are blocked and ischemic, the color of the corresponding optic papilla may partially or completely become lighter, and the optic papilla may also have partial or total edema. Edema is usually mild, protruding about 1 to 3 diopters. The degree of edema varies greatly from person to person and generally occurs near the optic disc. There may be a small amount of flame-like bleeding on the optic disc or the retina nearby, usually quadrants. There are usually no significant changes in retinal blood vessels. If you are a patient with arteriosclerosis, retinal arteriosclerosis can be seen in the fundus. After papilledema resolves, the color of the corresponding area becomes pale or pale. In some cases, there may be obvious papilla edema but there may be no obvious impairment of visual function. This special condition may be related to the fact that edema caused by ischemia in the optical papilla does not form a complete blockade of the optic nerve fibers. Sometimes papilla edema can be found in the contralateral eye of a patient who has clearly developed vision loss caused by ischemic optic neuropathy, but his vision is completely normal. During observation, it can be seen that papilla edema is significantly aggravated, and the vision decreases accordingly. This uncommon phenomenon may be related to chronic or subacute ischemia in the optic nerve causing only poor axoplasmic flow but not optic nerve fiber infarction."}

This is related to the Zinn-Haller ring supplying the cribriform area, which is composed of two branches of the posterior short ciliary artery, which is different from the extremely neat visual path damaged visual field with hemianopia or quadrantabopia bounded by the median line. This suggests that in ischemic optic neuropathy, the optic nerve fibers at the optic disc are damaged.

In terms of vision decline, optic neuritis is characterized by sudden decline. Multiple sclerosis is mostly progressive vision decline, but there are also sudden declines. In patients with optic neuritis, the lesions only manifest as optic nerve damage, while in multiple sclerosis, optic nerve lesions are only a component of nervous system lesions. People with simple optic neuritis may develop other symptoms and signs of central nervous system damage during long-term observation, and are ultimately diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

The application of immunosuppressants Before using corticosteroids, it is necessary to understand whether the patient has contraindications to the use of corticosteroids and to comprehensively and correctly evaluate the pros and cons of receiving treatment. In the acute phase, pulse therapy is generally used. The specific method is to use high-dose intravenous drip of methylprednisolone at a daily dose, and then oral prednisolone is changed after 3 to 5 days. Dexamethasone can also be administered intravenously daily, and changed to the corresponding dose of prednisone orally after about a week. After the condition stabilizes, the dose will be gradually reduced until the dose is stopped. Because prednisone has a shorter half-life than dexamethasone, it has less inhibitory effect on the adrenal cortex. In order to reduce the side effects of long-term use of corticosteroids, alternate day therapy can be used, that is, a certain dose of corticosteroids can be taken every other morning. During treatment, attention should be paid to the effects of drugs on bone marrow suppression and damage to liver and kidney functions. Immunosuppressants may only shorten the duration of acute attacks and reduce the damage caused by the disease, fail to prevent recurrence, and are ineffective for chronic patients.

{"title":"Section VI\tneuromyelitis optica","text":"Neuromyelitis optica (NMO) is an acute or subacute disease involving demyelinating lesions of the optic nerve and spinal cord simultaneously or successively. It was first reported by Devic in 1894, so it is also known as Devic's disease. Because there are demyelinating changes in the nervous tissue at the affected site during the pathogenesis, which is a pathological change in the development of multiple sclerosis, there are still different views on whether this lesion is essentially an independent disease entity or a subtype of multiple sclerosis. Clinical and pathological studies in our country have confirmed that the disease is an early manifestation of multiple sclerosis. As the disease develops, it is difficult to distinguish the two. In particular, there is no essential difference in pathological examination. It seems reasonable to attribute the disease to the subtype of multiple sclerosis. Clinical research results in recent years have shown that the nervous system manifestations of patients with neuromyelitis optica are limited to the optic nerve and spinal cord, and most of them present transverse spinal cord damage, while spinal type multiple sclerosis is mostly incomplete transverse damage; the average cerebral effusion cell count of patients with neuromyelitis optica is significantly higher than that of patients with spinal type multiple sclerosis. MRI examination showed intracranial nerve lesions in 12.5% of patients with neuromyelitis optica, and 83.3% of patients with spinal multiple sclerosis had intracranial nerve abnormalities. Large longitudinal fusion lesions in the spinal cord may be present in 64.7% of patients with neuromyelitis optica, compared with only 21.6% of patients with spinal multiple sclerosis. Therefore, it is believed that neuromyelitis optica and spinal multiple sclerosis should be two independent disease entities. As far as the current situation is concerned, there are no specific examination indicators for optic neuropathy and optic neuromyelitis in multiple sclerosis. Some clinical manifestations of the two have similar characteristics. The essential differences or classification of the two still need further study. The cause of the disease is still unknown, and it currently tends to be related to infection and allergic reactions. The main pathological characteristics are severe inflammatory cell reactions and necrotic foci in the affected optic nerve and spinal cord. Occasionally, the brain and brain stem may be involved, and demyelinating plaques of varying severity appear. Spinal cord lesions can span multiple segments, and can be involved in white matter or gray matter. They are severe in the center. They can have extensive softening, necrosis and cavity formation, and inflammatory cell infiltration around the blood vessels."}

{"title":"Section VI\tneuromyelitis optica","text":"[Differential diagnosis] The differential diagnosis from other optic neuropathy is basically the same as the differential diagnosis of multiple sclerosis. The differentiation between neuromyelitis optica and multiple sclerosis including the optic nerve and spinal cord type not only differs in the pathology of optic neuropathy, but also mainly reflects differences in spinal cord damage. Identification can be made by examination of the nervous system. The lesions of optic neuromyelitis are confined to the optic nerve and spinal cord, and gray matter is often affected at the same time. Lesions are often necrotic, with no obvious glial cell proliferation, often lack inflammatory infiltration, and have vascular hyaline changes and fibrosis. The pathological changes of multiple sclerosis are mainly white matter, with multiple scattered demyelinating lesions, and obvious gliosis. The main clinical feature of optic neuromyelitis is that the neurological manifestations are limited to the optic nerve and spinal cord, whether initially or throughout follow-up. Multiple sclerosis is characterized by multiple demyelination in the central nervous system, and spinal type multiple sclerosis is no exception. Most patients in the myelitis group have transverse spinal cord damage, with more serious consequences, and most of spinal multiple sclerosis are incomplete transverse manifestations. Clinical observations have shown that patients with neuromyelitis optica have more severe lesions, and the incidence of blindness and paralysis is higher than that of patients with spinal multiple sclerosis."}

CHRPE has been observed in newborns and children, providing strong evidence of the congenital nature of the disease. The etiology of RPE cell abnormalities is unclear and has recently been attributed to melanomas, and some people believe to be hamartoma of the RPE. Relative scotoma corresponding to the lesion and mild photoreceptor cell degeneration above the lesion in young patients, compared with deep, absolute scotoma and late photoreceptor cell degeneration in elderly patients, suggest that the initial abnormalities of the lesion are limited to RPE cells. Above the abnormal RPE cells, the retina develops relatively normally. It may be that the abnormal RPE is unable to maintain the integrity of the photoreceptor cells, leading to their progressive degeneration. The presence of a large number of melanosomes indicates abnormal metabolism, which not only leads to the degeneration of photoreceptor cells, but also ultimately leads to the death of RPE cells and the formation of depigmented spots."}

Electrooculograms (EOG) and electroretinogram (ERG) in patients with CHRPE are normal, providing functional evidence of the localized nature of this lesion. Neither isolated, unilateral CHRPE lesions nor retinal mass pigment changes were accompanied by ocular or extraocular abnormalities. However, multiple and bilateral CHRPE lesions may be accompanied by Gardner syndrome, an autosomal dominant disease characterized by adenomatous polyps of the large and small intestine, hamartomas of the bone, and various soft tissue swelling. This correlation suggests that ophthalmologists should detect CHRPE early to prevent the risk of intestinal malignancies."}
{"title":"Section II\tTumor of the retina  1. Congenital retinal pigment epithelium hypertrophy","text":"CHRPE can be easily and correctly diagnosed using modern examination techniques. However, early reports and a review of histopathological data suggest that CHRPE has been frequently misdiagnosed. The most common misdiagnosis is as choroidal malignant melanoma. Choroidal melanomas are almost always raised, are more uneven, have clearer boundaries than CHRPE, and show growth in all three dimensions. Choroidal moles are located deep in the RPE and are flat. They can vary in color from light to dark brown, have boundaries that are not as clear as CHRPE and are feathery (because mole cells can extend along large choroidal vessels). Drusen and pigmented markings are usually present on the surface of moles, indicating the long-term existence of moles. Choroidal melanocytomas have similar manifestations except that they are black in color. The boundary of true RPE hyperplasia is also unclear and invades the retina, usually leading to deformation of the retina. Local pigmentation caused by injury, inflammation, or drug toxicity can be similar to CHRPE, but can be identified by clues such as its more irregular shape, widespread distribution, and its acquired characteristics."}

When lesions of different sizes are arranged in clusters, they are like animal footprints, called pigmentations, or bear tracks. The color of lesions can range from light gray brown to black, regardless of the patient's ethnicity. There may be hypopigmented or depigmented blank areas in large lesions. The superior retina and blood vessels appear normal in most cases, and discontinuous local intraretinal pigmentation can occasionally be seen on the margins of the lesion through biomicroscopes.

Rapidly advancing hypertensive arterioles can produce acute vasospasm. However, the more common clinical cause is the general constriction of the retinal artery caused by chronic hypertension. In normal people, the ratio of arterial and venous is 2:3, but at this time the ratio can change to 1:3 or even 1:4. Local strictures can also occur. Due to local spasm of small arteries, stenosis can occur in different parts of the same blood vessel, causing the blood vessel to have irregular diameters that narrow in some places and expand in some places. When blood pressure continues to rise, after several months or years, the blood vessels undergo organic changes and form hardening. When the arteries harden, due to the hyaline change in the middle layer of the vessel wall with lipid and calcareous deposits and fibrosis, the vessel wall thickens, the lumen narrows, the blood vessel reflective band widens and darkens, and loses transparency. The arteries appear yellow-red copper wire shape reflects light, called \"copper wire artery\". If blood pressure continues to increase for a long time, the degree of arteriosclerosis will become more serious, the wall of the vessel will become thicker, the blood column in the blood vessel will be almost invisible, and the reflective band will become wider.

At the same time, due to the thickening of the arterial wall and loss of its transparency, the venous blood column under the artery cannot be seen clearly. When severe hardening, the vein is crushed and the blood flow is completely invisible, which is called venous concealment. When the vein crosses over the artery, the vein is compressed and becomes thinner, the veins on both sides of the artery become thinner and sharpened, or the diameter of the proximal end of the intersection becomes sharpened. Marcus Gunn was the first to notice the change at the intersection. The vein is compressed under the artery, and the two ends of the vein narrow into a fusiform is called Gunn's sign.

For example, those with hypertension before pregnancy, the hardening is more obvious. Arterial stenosis, enhanced reflection, and some of them can still see the phenomenon of arterial and venous crossing.

Or cause capillary occlusion, which can occur in the macula area or the periphery of the retina, causing vision loss. It can also be caused by severe central retinal artery spasm secondary to optic nerve atrophy, resulting in reduced vision. In severe cases, papilledema may occur, or acute optic nerve ischemic lesions may occur due to impaired blood supply to the optic nerve in the cribriform plate area, resulting in loss or loss of vision. In severe cases, serous retinal detachment can occur. The detachment is often bilateral, spherical, and is mostly located below the retina, or can affect the entire retina. There is fluid under the retina, and exudate can come from the retina and choroid, or from the choroid alone. Because high blood pressure damages the choroidal capillaries and the pigment epithelium above them, the choroidal vessels can also exude or occlude, and fluid enters the subretinal space. Retinal detachment has a good prognosis and does not require surgery.

The clinical feature is sudden painless monocular vision loss. At first, it looks like a black gauze curtain covering the eyes of the eyes, and suddenly becomes completely blind from top to bottom or from bottom to top. It lasts for several seconds or a minute. Sometimes it lasts for several minutes. Usually, the vision returns to normal after the attack.

If the arterial pressure is lower than the intraocular pressure, the artery collapses without a blood column, and blood flow stops. In addition to changes in systemic blood pressure, the reasons for insufficient blood flow can also be caused by spasm of the distal artery of the thrombus, or temporary thrombus formed on the atheroma, or hemorrhage under the atheroma causing the atheroma to bulge, causing more narrow blood vessels., resulting in insufficient blood flow. 37% of patients with transient amaurosis may be accompanied by temporary cerebral ischemia or stroke."}

{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  EPIDEMIOLOGY","text":"Hypertensive retinopathy can be divided into chronic and acute phases. The most commonly used classification is the Keith-Wagener-Barker classification. The grades of hypertensive retinopathy are as follows:"}

{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  EPIDEMIOLOGY","text":"Grades 1 and 2 are commonly seen in practice. Grade 3 and 4 changes are much less frequently seen."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY","text":"Grades 1 and 2: Hyalinization and thickening of the retinal arterial walls is seen, leading to the straightened vessels in grade 1 and the indentation (arteriovenous nicking) of the retinal veins by the arteries in grade 2 hypertensive retinopathy. Arteriovenous nicking of a retinal vein does not occur at an arteriovenous crossing unless the retinal artery is located anterior to the retinal vein, a phenomenon which occurs in approximately two-thirds of the arteriovenous crossings in the posterior pole."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY","text":"Grade 3: The systemic diastolic blood pressure in an adult with grade 3 hypertensive retinopathy is typically at least 105 to 110 mm Hg. At this point, the retinal arteries lose their ability to autoregulate the blood flow, and the high pressure is passed distally to the retinal arterioles and capillary bed. This same clinical signs can be seen in children when the systolic blood is in the nineties."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  PATHOPHYSIOLOGY","text":"Grade 4: The systemic diastolic blood pressure in an adult with grade 4 hypertensive retinopathy is usually at least 130 to 140 mmHg. With both grades 3 and 4 hypertensive retinopathy, the increased blood pressure can damage the blood vessel wall, leading to fibrinoid necrosis (the presence of fibrin thrombi within the vascular lumina). A similar process occurs with hypertensive choroidopathy, leading to necrosis of the overlying retinal pigment epithelium (Elschnig spot)."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  CLINICAL SIGNS","text":"Grade 1 and 2 changes are chronic, whereas grade 3 and 4 changes indicate acute retinal vascular decompensation."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  CLINICAL SIGNS","text":"Hypertensive choroidopathy (Elschnigspots) may accompany grade 3 and 4 changes. Elschnig spots are round and yellow acutely, eventually changing to pigmented lesions."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  DIFFERENTIAL DIAGNOSIS","text":"Diabetic retinopathy, radiation retinopathy,venous occlusive disease, carotid artery occlusive disease (ocular ischemic syndrome), and collagen vascular diseases can all mimic the changes of hypertensive retinopathy."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION","text":"Measurement of the systemic blood pressure is critical when the diagnosis is suspected. If the acute changes (grades 3 and 4)are classic and the blood pressure is not elevated at the time of measurement, consideration should be given to the possibility that the blood pressure has been uncontrolled recently or is uncontrolled at other times during the day."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT","text":"Vision is typically unaffected with grades 1 and 2 hypertensive retinopathy and may be mildly decreased with grade 3 retinopathy."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT","text":"With grade 4 retinopathy, vision can be markedly decreased due to retinal edema, hard exudates in the central macula (macular star)and\/or the presence of a serous retinal detachment."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT","text":"The treatment for hypertensive retinopathy is to correct the underlying condition by normalizing the blood pressure. This causes resolution of the fundus abnormalities over a period of weeks to months in eyes with grade 3 and 4 changes, but often does not affect the changes seen with grades 1 and 2 hypertensive retinopathy."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT","text":"Laser therapy has not been shown to be of benefit in treating the visual loss associated with grade 3 and 4 hypertensive retinopathy. Correcting the blood pressure after grade 4 retinopathy can lead to visual improvement, although there may be residual, permanent visual loss due to vascular shutdown in hypertensive choroidopathy, hypertensive retinopathy, hypertensive optic neuropathy. Oral nifedipine has been suggested for the treatment of acute grade 4 hypertensive retinopathy."}
{"title":"HYPERTENSIVE RETINOPATHY  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT","text":"Theoretically, intravitreal VEGF-A inhibitor therapy with ranibizumab and\/or bevacizumab could stabilize the walls of retinal of vessels with grade 3 or 4 systemic arterial hypertension changes.

Patients with phakic RDs with a single, superior retinal break without vitreous hemorrhage, extensive lattice degeneration, or early PVR do best. This relatively noninvasive, lowcost,quick-recovery office procedure is gaining in acceptance."}

{"title":"CHOROIDAL DETACHMENT  DIAGNOSTIC EVALUATION","text":"B-scan ultrasonography confirms the diagnosis and helps distinguish between serous and hemorrhagic detachment. It also will show evidence of inflammation of the sclera or orbit and can help distinguish detachment from neoplasm."}
{"title":"CHOROIDAL DETACHMENT  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT","text":"The prognosis for patients with serous choroidal detachment is generally favorable if the underlying etiology can be reversed. Restoration of normal intraocular pressure and eradication of inflammation are generally adequate to reverse this process."}
{"title":"CHOROIDAL DETACHMENT  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT","text":"Hemorrhagic detachment can produce severe pain or marked elevation of intraocular pressure requiring prompt surgical drainage. Otherwise, the condition can generally be observed and will slowly resolve."}
{"title":"CHOROIDAL DETACHMENT  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT","text":"If the vitreous or retina is adherent to anterior structures such as a cataract wound, vitrectomy is indicated or else RD will occur as the choroidal detachment resolves."}
{"title":"CHOROIDAL DETACHMENT  PROGNOSIS AND MANAGEMENT","text":"Surgical drainage is usually recommended for \"kissing choroidals,\" although the necessity and optimal timing of this procedure are controversial."}
